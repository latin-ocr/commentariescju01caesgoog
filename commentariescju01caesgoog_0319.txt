l. a. [6.] aare importatum probably from the ancient copper mines
in Dalecarlia. Those in England were not worked with any spirit till
the eighteenth century.

l. 4. [7.] leporem, gallinam, anserem. The hare, as is well known,
was forbidden by the Mosaic law; nor is there any mention in the Bible
of chiekens and geese as articles os food. Hare appears to have been
considered unhealthy in various ways: geese and chiclrens probably
required more com-leeding than they would get in Britain to make
thern palatable.

l. 5. [8.] animi oausu; so Penelope in Od. 19. 537 says of her geese‚
marre σφιν ἰαίνομαι εἷσοροῶσα.

1. 7. [9.] remissioribus frigoribus, ‘since the cold is more inter-
rupted!

l. ra. [e. 13. n. 1.] vergit ad Hispania-n, ‘looks out towards Spain'
Tacit. (Agric. 34) actually says that Ireland is between Britain and
Spain.

l. 14. [a] pari atque, like ‘eodem atque!

l. 16. [3.] Mona, called by Ptolemy Monoeda or Moneitha, by Bede·
Monavia. The latter form seems to connect it with Menevia (St.

‘amass')‚ whence it can mean a mountain, an island, or a headland. ¹

l. ra [4.] nisi certis ex aqua mensuris, ‘except that (nisi quod) by

would probably have used the clepsydra ol Ctesibius, in which water
was made to drop upon wheels, which were¹ thereby turned. See Dict.
ol Antiq, art. Horologium. ’

l. aa. [5,] oontm septentriones, that is the east coast of Britain is
opposed first to the German coast, and then, as it faces gradually to the
north, the Ocean only.

l. 23, [6.] maxime, ‘nearly’ ‘pretty much!

l. 27. [o.14.n.1.] humanissimi ; whence Shakespeare's well-known
lines (Henry VI, 1. 4, 7)-

‘Kent in the Commentaries Caesar writ,

l. 31. [a] vitro inficiunt. whence Ovid calls us the ‘virides Britanni?
They were tattooed with ‘variae animalium effigies! Can it be that
