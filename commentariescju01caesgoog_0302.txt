l. 3. [13] locta diuidisaimts, ⁴ in spite ul the extreme oold of their
climate:' concessive abl, absolute See a. ra, note a.

l. 3. [14.] neque heberent . . et lavarentur, dre.. ‘on the one hand
they wear only skins, and on the other they bathe in the icy streame!
The ‘haberent' and ‘lavarentur’ are, irregularly, ,in the imperf. subj‚
much as Cic. Mil. 13 has ‘adepti estis ne quem metueretis: In both
cases the construction seems to lollow the implied idea ‘connisi estis
(sont),' rather than the actual words in which the successdrd endeavour
is expressed. ‘They have habituated themselves to what they wanted,
hemely, the practice of bathmg in the coldest water! The reading
of MSS. ‘lavantur‚’ seems untenable; as ‘lavere' is used only by the
poets and the very earliest prose writers.

l. 6. [c. 2. n..r.] magle eo . . . quam ono, dre„ ‘rather with the
· view os frnding purchasers lor their spoli, than because they want
any imports! This is a modification of the more usual phrase, ot
which Ter. Eun. 1. a. 16 isa good example, ‘non quo *quemquam
plus amem, eo feei, sed-3 ‘lhave d6ne this, not because 1 love any
one better. but because—J

l. 8. [a] desiderent, simply ‘desire‚'as in Plin. Hist. Nat. 17. 26.
‘desiderant rigari arbores!

l. 9. [3.] impenso pretio, probably literally ‘at a large price;¹ not Ι

‘having expended a large snm? Thus we have ‘impensius damnum‚'
aud even ‘cuius cibo iste sactus est impensior‚' ‘by whose sood that
lellow has got latter: Plaut. Capt. 4. a, 26.

l. 12. [4.] summi laboris: see r. 39, note a.

' l. 13. [5.] eodem vestigio, ‘on the ¹same spot?

l. 17. [6.] quumvis pauci (sint), ‘however lew they may be’ This
is the original meaning of ‘quamnim‘ und the subjunctive almost
invariably used after it is thus accounted sor.

l. ro. [o. 8. n. 1.] publice, ‘in a public way‚' thetis, ‘to them
considered as states! So the same idea is expressed in 6. 23.

l. 23. [a] una ex parte a Suebis. Lit. ‘on one side in the
direction os the Suebi: that is, ‘on one side os the Suevian domuin! '

l. 24. [3.] ad alteram partem, as the Ubii were iu the neighbour-
hood oi Cologne‚ the waste country on the other side oi the Chatti
(4. 1, note 4) must have been the present Wtirtemburg, Ravana, and
Baden. Its extent is here much exaggerated.

1. 25. [4.] ut eet . . captus Germanorum, so Ter. Adelph. 3. 4, 34,

‘ ut est captus servornm· (id quod capiunt servi). ·

l. 32. [5.] vectigales, an adjective; ‘vectigali a substantive.

l. 32. [6.] multo humiliores redegerunt, ‘reduced them to a much
lower condition! A similarly proleptic nse os adjectives is found in a.
