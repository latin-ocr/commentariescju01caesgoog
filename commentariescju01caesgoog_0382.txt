Dordogne. It cerered nearly the whdle west front of Uxellodunum,
which is what Caesar means by ¹ totum paene montem cingebat!

Ρ. 202. l. a. [e. 41. u. ia] aggerem. This was a large wooden
terrace. raised forthe purpose oi bearing the tower presently to be
described. At the point where it was erected considerable masses of
