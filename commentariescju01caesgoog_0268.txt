1. ²4. [7.] oum vellet, congrederetur, as ‘congrediatur' is the direct
imperative, it follows that ‘congrederetur'is the depressed imperative
in the oblique sentence.

1. ²4· [8.] quid virtute possent, ‘what the Germans were worth in
the way os valour' (chap. 3, note 4).

1. 25. [9.] inter annos quatuordeeim, so Kraner end Nipperdey;
alii. ‘intra’ The meaning oi ⁴ inter’ is well shown by Livy, 1. 10, ‘bina
postea inter tot annos, tot bella, opima parta sunt spolie' (ull through
so many years, διο.) ‘Intra’ would mean ‘since iourteen years began,’·
or ‘before iourteen years' end!

l. ²7· [o. ³7. n. 1.] haee eodem tempore . . et. The two contem-⁹

commode supportari posset trumentum: in chap. 39. Observe that
‘resisti’ is impersonal. the 'illi' which it governs being omitted.

l. 4. [5.] magnis itineribus. See Veget. 1.9, ‘militari gradu xx.
milia passuum horis quinque dumtaxat aestivis conficiuntur: pleno
autern gradu, qui citatior est, xxiv. milia peragenda sunt’ The Roman
mile is, however, only 1614 yards.

l. 5. [6.] ad Ariovistum, ‘upon Ariovistus3' ie. directly against
him.

1. 5. [o. 88. n. 1.] tridui3 see chap. 23, note r.
