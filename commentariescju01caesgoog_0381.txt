1.13. [a] provincias. ‘departments oi action;’ as in Cic. Sull. 18 lin.
‘provinciam sibi depoposcit, ut..me in meo lectulo trucidaret? This p
makes the derivation from 'providentia' mone probable than that from l
‘provinca’ which is still given in some dictionaries. See Mommsen, p
Roman Hist, vol. 2, p. 71 (note). This explains the phrase in c. 39, ξ
‘reliquam esse uuam aestatem suae provinciae.¹ li this derivation is ’
correct, the original ‘providentia' may be contracted in two ways. Ii

1. 34 [a] accepta referebant. ‘put down ¹to the account oi'
Gutnutus. Caesar's yielding to the cry oi his soldiers on this occasion
must be contrastedwith his masterpieces of skill in putting down any
cry when he chose to do so. See 1. 40, and the instances aod remarks
given in Bacca, Adv. of Leaming. book ι.

P. 201. l. 1. [3.] securi feriretur. This was the punishment ‘more
