1. 27. [a] belli gerendi, ‘for a regular war with them!
1. 29. [3.] Britanniae, &c., ‘he thought thot these small matters of
occupatiori ought not to be preferred to his British enterprisez' literally‚

y ‘toBritain‚’bycompendiarycomparison. So‘ave’is used lor‘quam

quod potest avis‚' in ovid, Psittacus,
‘ora suere mihi plus ave docta loqui!

l. 31. [4.] coactis contractisque, ‘having been collected and mus-
tered! The reading ¹constratis,' ‘decked vessels,’ would make it appear
that the troops were not embarked on the ‘ onerariae! But it is evident
that they were so embarked, at the rate of 100 meu per vessel. Each
oi the eighteen remaining ships would carry twenty-five homes, the
cavalry would be therefore 450 in rurmber.

P. 76. l. a. [5.] ab milibus pascuum octo, ‘in the port os Amble·
teuse. where they had been windbound (naturally, as the position of the
two ports shows) by the same brecze which was favourable ior Caesar's
transit.

l. 10. [o. 28. n. a] tertia vigilia, ‘at midnight,’ and ou the 26th of
August¹‚ B.C. 55. For the suu moon occurred (c. 29) four days aiter;
and all astronomers are agreed that the moon was suli on the night of
Aug. 30 (accuratelyaty amon the 31st). Tide-tables show that on
that day it was high water at Boulogne at about 7³5 pm.. for the tide
is sorty-eight minutes later than the corresponding tide on the previous
day: and it was high water at Boulogne at 1135 pm. on the 31st‚ the
day oi the sull moon. Thus the eud oi the flood and the beginning ot'
the ebb were,occupied by Caesar’s fleet in dropping down the harbour;
and the fleet was ready to sail by midnight

l.1a. [a] liora quarta: he reached the Dover shore at about 8.3o
(the first hour at this season was at 5.6)‚ and then rode at anchor, sor
his transports to come up, till about 530. There had been high water
at Dover on that day at 736 a.m.; for it was high tide at Boulogne at
749, and Dover tides are thirteen minutes in advance of those of
Boulogne.

l. 21. [3.] ut rei militaria ratio. δια, ‘as, he said, all military prac-
tice, especially that on board ship, required' The subjunctive being the
quasi-oblique seems to induce Caesar to put ‘ut' instead ot ‘quod,'
which would be more natural.

l. ²4· [4.] ventum et aestum secundum. The tidal current off
Dover turns irum east to west four hours aiter high water, and then
runs west ior seven hours· Theresore as high water had been at 7.36
am. on that day. the current had turned at 11.36‚ and had to run west,
in the direction of Romney, till 6.36 pm.
