Rhine. lt is plain, in the first place, irom geological evidence (Esquiros,
The Dutch at Home, p. 8), that the Rhine must have been at some time
or other a vast body os water directing itseli towards the sea by way oi
Leyden and what is now the Zuyder Zee, and at times covering with its
waters a large part oi Utrecht, Overyssel, and Guelderland. Advancing
in this direction it would meet the maximum soree of the German
Oeean (see 5. 7, note 3); which would gradually (as the climate oi
Europe became milder and the river lost volume) succeed in gaining
upon the Rhine and silting 'up its outlets in this direction. Thus the
stream would be driven farther south in search os an issue. In the time
os the Roman emperors a balance still seems to have existed between
the volume of water conveyed by the northern and southern mouths, the
Waal and the Rhine. For we find Civilis, the insurgent Batavian, de·
stroying a dam raised by Drusus near the embranchment os these two
rivers. The object oi the dam seems to have been to keep the waters
from the Waal charmel and direct thern to the old Rhine; that os
Civilis to move the frontier of his country further south by drawing
them back to the Waal.

l.11. [3.] Nantuates, as this nation (supra 3. 1) inhabited French
Savoy, it is not easy to see how they can be east of the Furlra. Strabo
places a nation called the ‘Aetuates' in the required position. Perhaps
this should be the reading here. Or, as ‘Naut' means astream, the
name may simply stand for ‘river-solli?

1. 14. [4.] ioris nationibus. See Motiey, Rise oi the Dutch Republic
(Introduction), ior an admirable account of the ancient Batavians.

l. 18. [e. 11. n. r.] caesar ovim abesset. The name is placed at the

beginning as ii it were the nominative to the main verb; then the con-
struction alters.
· l. 23· [a] in Ubios legatos mittendi: from this passage mainly
Merivale concludes that the battle with the Usipetes was near Coblenz.
He holds it impossible that they could have proposed to send an enr-
bassy from Cleves to the neighbourhood oi Cologne, so as to return in
three days. Yet the difficulty would be hardly less on the other sup-
position, as the German cavalry would then have had to get from the
lower Meuse to Coblenz in the same time. It is possible either that
‘ad eas res conficiendas’ may mean ‘in order to arrange for, the
embassy‚’ or that the ambassadors wildly pressed sor these three days
without closely considering what they promised to accomplish in them.
Or finally, the narrative may be deficient in good saith on Caesar's part.
See ffle'iollowing notes.

1. 27. [3.] eodem pertinere, ‘tended to the same object? Note the
use oi this word in 1.1. ‘Eodem' is os course an adverb.

1. 50. [4.] aquationis causa, that is, he wished to advanee as sar as

the small stream now called the Niers.
