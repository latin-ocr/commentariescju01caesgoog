without an exertion of mind, realise, as his own contemporaries
did, the thoroughness of his double failure there. Moreover, the
notes on Book V will make it probable that he has 'most scan-
dalously libelled our gallant countrymen, and made writer after
writer in England believe that they were mere vicious barbarians,
instead of being a warlike and disciplined race, at least equal in

advancement to the Seikhs of our own day. Besides thisbe· ¹

seems hardly to have noticed the great accession of ferocity on
the Roman side in the Gallie wars which followed the British
failures3 and though his stating candidly the facts which shew
’ this, such as the unrepented massacre at Avaricum, and the
starving of the unarmed multitudes at Alesia, may be considered
as marking his good saith, yet his want of moral sense on such
points makes us suspect that he may, oftener than he admits,
have been guilty of such cruelties as Hirtius casually describes in
Vlll. 44, as inflicted on the gallant defenders of Uxellodunum,
whose right hands were all cut off by Caesar’s order. So again
when we know what is often the conduct towards their subjects
of protected kings in India, we feel that a conqueror like Caesar,
who imposed upon the Gallie republics the yoke of monarchic
families, whom they detested (the Shah Soojahs of the period),
and had long ago deposed, might, if he would, have written many
asad chapter on the means by which, under his auspices, these
protected sovereigns maintained their illegal authority. Lastly,
when we see that no hint is given in the history of the fate re·
served for the gallant Vercingetorix on the day of Caesar’s
triumph, years after the surrender of Alesia, we feel an appre-
hension that the great conqueror’s daily life in Gaul would have
supplied many exceptions to the ‘clementia' of which he so
often speaks as marking his own conduct. Probably therefore it
is not too much to say that the suppression oi unwelcome tmth is
a feature not to be ignored by any one who reads the Bellum Galli-
cum critically, especially when it is observed how the same reserve
seems perpetually to affect the minuter points of narratives which
are on the whole truthful. But with these abatements, for which
allowance may easily be made, how much is to be said for Caesar’s
narrative! ln the first place, it photographs for us a nation corn·
pounded of the most diverse tribes, whose habits too have a
peculiar interest to ourselves, both from our partly Celtic blood,
