and from the fact that so many of the circumstances mentioned
by him retrace themselves in our Indian empire.

ln the next place, it may be truly said that, as a military
manual, the Commentaries are almost unrivalled in the variety of
service which they describe. Caesar conducta in tbe course of
them almost every conceivable military operation. He defeats,
in Book 1, a vast national immigration, that of the Helvetii; and
then the Germaminvader Ariovistus, whose very name is an object
of superstitious terror to his soldiers. next, the vast confederacy
of the Belgae assails him. As long as their various nations remain
in one combined force, he keeps them at arm’s length by simple
works fortifying a well-chosen position on the Aisne; and then,
when they recoil before the difficulty (as the Duke of Brunswick
didon nearly the same ground in 1792), he forces them nation by
nation to yield tobis arms. This is done by sheer rapidity of
movement, such as to force several of the single nations to sur-
rende'r without a blow. In Book 111 he performs the almost un·
- paralleled exploit of defeating the Armorican fleet, in spite of its
unbounded naval superiority. ln the next book, he overthrows
a second German immigration as formidable as that of Ariovistus,
and adjourns for centuries the day when the Germans are to
burst the barrier of the Rhine. Here is the culminating point of
his fortune; for the failure in Britain involves him in unceasing
troubles and difficulties up to the end of his history. But his
powerful genius carries him through all. He makes head with
decisive vigour against the final and desperate revolt of the entire
country of Gaul. Legions are cut oli to the last man; henas
to raise the siege of Gergovia, on the capture of which all seems
to depend. But the Gauls can obtain no real advantage3 a series

of decisive strokes enables him at length to coop up all his enemies ν

in the single town of Alesia, and then by a double system of siege
works, such as the world had never seen till then, he repels at the
same time all sallies from the town and all attacks from a most
powerful relieving army, and ultimately forces the city to sur-
render. These main operations are also relieved and diversified
by a number of smaller ones, which exhibit his skill in mining
at Uxellodunum his ready power in adopting new tactics, in
his imitation of the mixed cavalry and infantry formation of
the Germans; bis audacious innovations in war, as when he
