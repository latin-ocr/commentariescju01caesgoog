Labienus had been encampod on the site os modern Paris, nearly where
S. Germain l'Auxerrois is now. He sent the boats down the river as
Ἴ far as Point du Jour (it would have been impossible to work them up
the stream to Melun again), withthe intention of forcing the passage
there, while the attention ol the enemy was distracted by the soldiers
lest in the camp, and also by the cohorts which he had sent up the river.
The unequal division of his troops seems intended to give an advantage
to one of his detachments. as the enemy would probably divide their
forces more equally. He of course hazardcd the detachment which went
north, a risk which could not have been ventured in presence oi amore
skilsul enemy.

1. 29. [3.] Semiavi, their capital was Lyons (Lugdunum), as
Bibracte was that os the Aedui. The Volcae naturally held off from
the consederacy, as from their isolated position (see a. 1, note 2) among
hostile nations the Roman power was a support to them. The Helvii
probably feared the Arverni and were therefore inclined to Rome.
