Liv. 22. 60, ‘Tum Tit. Manlius Torquatus, priscae et nimis durae

l. 3ο. [3.] liceri. The root of this verb seems to be the sameas that
of the verb ‘linquo’ (Curtius Griech Etym. vol. 1. p. 50.) Hence
we have, first, the middle or deponent form ‘liceor‚’ ‘to get a thing
left to oneseli' and thence ‘to bid for it,' and secondly, the intransitive
form ‘liceo,’ meaning ‘to be left (that is, sold) at a given price? On
the revenues farmed by Dumnorix, see Mr. Iong's interesting note.

l. 8. [7.] potentia cius. In chsp. 5, note 4 we heve seen ¹ cum iis'
used for ‘secum' in order to prevent confusion as to the subject referred
to. Here the object of writing ‘ eius’ instead of ‘suu' seems to have
been to express distinctly that the power of Dumnorix had been really
diminished: ¹ ‘potentie sua’ might have ineant only thot he said it had
been diminished.

l. 10. [8.] si quid occidat Romanis: litotes, a gentle way of soying
anything ill-omened; like ⁸ animadvertere‚' ‘to punish‚' ef τι πάθοιεν, ‘if
