„ 256 noran. soor nr, enar. 15-17.

1. 19. [13.] nullum paullo tornius caesum, ‘no action at all dis·
tinguished ;' understand ‘solito’

l. ²4· [e. 15. n. 1.] contendebant. emundandae-unt. See r. 53, note
3. Here the meaning is, ‘managed to board,' ‘endeavoured to save
themselves by flight’

l. 28. [a] malacia, μαλακία.

1. 31. [3.] ut perpaucae.. ,ad terram pervenerint Other editions
read ‘pervenirent' The perfect lays more stress on the fact as occur·
ring at a given point ol time, the imperfect on its being a consequence
of the preceding proposition. So we have (Cic. de F in. 2. ao), ‘Thorius
erat ita non timidus ad mortem, ut in acie sit ob rempublicam inter·
lectus! 'Thorius ieared death so little that he was killed in battle for
the state·

l. 33. [4.] oum...puanaretur, ‘since the battle had been going 0n;’
(praeteritum ad praesens; see 3. 5,, note 1).

1. 33. [5.] ab hors...cuerta; as these events happened about the
end of the summer, the first honr would have been about 6 am. In'
winter the military rechoning of hours would have begun about two
hours later. and in summer about two hours earlier. See M. leverrier's
Tabim J ules cesar, vol. a. app.

P. eal. 4 [o.16.n.1.] navium quod ubique marat, ‘all the
ships that they had anywhere had ;’ partitive genitive.

l. 9. [a] quo mugentiua, dc.. ‘that they might observe more accu-
rately the law ol enbaaies! So ‘diligentia' is used in 1. 40, note⁸ and
constantly.

. 1. 9. [3.] a barbarie, ‘by these barbarians;' thetis, ‘in spite of their
barbarism-³

l. 10. [4] reliquos sub coronavendidits this can hardly mean that
Caesar sold the whole nation by auction. The mention of the senate
makes it probable that the inhabitants of the capital, Dariorigum, are
meant. Even so the rigour is terrible; and the more so, as regards
the senate, from the grim alternative which the next chapter suggests,
as the only one open to these unfortunate rulers.

1.13. [c.1'l.n.1.] Venellorum this is the true reading of which
Unelli is a corruption. See Gltek. Keltische Namen (in voce). Observe
that ‘Aulerci Eburovices’ is one name, ‘the Aulerci ol Evreux :' so the
lexovii gave their name to Lisieux.

l. 16. [a] exereitum magnaeque coplae, ⁸ an army and considerable
war material! ‘Copias' cannot mean large supplies; lor these wene
deficient (c. 18). But it is difficult to understand it, as Kraner does, of
irregular forces. ·

1.16.[3.]ms paucis diebus. ‘within the present (same) few days?
So Livy has, ‘in hac magnificentia urbis.' ⁸ amid the present magnifi-
cence ol the city!
