282 uorsa. soor v, eurr. 17-20.

· l. 30. [3.] rari, so as to disquiet the whole of the Roman line. ·

l. 31. [4.] stationes dispositas baberent, ‘and also echeloned their
·chariots,' so as to attack in successive squadrons.

P. 92. l. 2. [o. 17.n.1.] tres legiones, an unparalleled number for a
foraging party. They went out probably towards Chilham.

l. 4. [a] sicuti ab legionibus non absisterent, sent off the foragers,
yet did not cease assaulting the legions.

1.6.[3.] neque finem sequendi feoenmt. After repelling the
enemy's charge, the legion advanoed steadily in pursuit; until at length
the cavalry, finding that they would be supported, dashed forward in
advance and drove the enemy before them.

l. rr. [4.] auxilia: the various contingents of British troops left Cas·
wallon's army. Quintus Cicero appears to have written about this
time to his brother in a tone of qualitied confidence; for the orator

t answers ‘cognovi nihil esse nec quod metuamus, uec quod gaudeamus'
(Ad Q. Fr. 3.1).

l. 15. [o. 18. n. 1.] uno omnino loeo ς Conway, Sunbnry, Petersham‚
Kingston, Wallingford, and even westminster, claim the honour of
Caesar's transit. The evidence is slight upon the point; except indeed
that the distance of eighty miles from the landing-place indicates a
point some distance up the Thames. All we can say is, that the passage
was probably above Teddington, where the river oeases to be tidal;
probably notfar above it, for Caesar was not likely, with the country
about St. Alban's for his object, to go up higher than he needed. He
had probably crossed the Medway at Aylesford, near Maidstone, and
the South Downs somewhere near Reigate3 and so marched across
by way of the present Ewell to Kingstononffhames. See the map at
4. ro.

1. ar. [a] oum eapite solo exstarent; see 1. 41, note 7. A ford
must now not be reported practicable for infantry, says Hyde (Fortis.
p. 180), if it is more than a yard deep. This shows us the value of the
legionary training which enabled the men to manage such difficulties.

l.27.[o.19.n.1.l milibus . . quartuor essedariorum, therefore
with about 600 chariots (4. 33, n. 1). .

P. 93. l. a. [a] hoo metu, ‘from sear of this ;¹ like ‘hoc dolore,’
1n 5. 4.

1. 5. [3.] labore atque itinere, ‘by exertion and vigorous marching.’

l.1o.[c.20.n.1.] ipse: asyndeton. Either this or ‘anaphora' is
'constantly used by Caesar in recounting antecedent circumstances. For
an instance of the latter, see 1.19 (init.): for the former, see 1. 31
throughout.

l. 13. [a] mittat qul obtineut; the context shows that they wished
for Mandubracius. It is'needless to point out how fatal this secession
was to the British cause.
