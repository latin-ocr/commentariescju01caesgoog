Vosges near Feldkirch; and then on the following day to a hill near
Reiningen. This last was a decisive movement; for a general who

method of cavalry fighting practised by the Germans.’

l. 30, [3.] singuu singulum in order that the influences of friendship
lnight come in. This mixed arrangement produced what Caesar ad·
mires in the British chariots (4. 33), ‘mobilitatem equitum, stabilitatem
peditum‚’ and he seems to have used this German mode of fighting
among his own German auxiliaries. See 7.13, and Bell. Civ. 3. 84.

north and south; so that Ariovistus could not escape without fighting.
Besides this, such an arrangement tempted the Germans strongly to an
attack on the entrenchments, which would be sure to give an advantage
to the Romans. Lastly‚ it gave an opportunity for the stratagem to be
described in 51, note ι. See Jules Cesar, plate 16.
