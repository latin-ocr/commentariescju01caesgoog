Our Aighan campaign gives a good hiut of the seelings of those ou
whom a king has been imposed in this way. Such a ruler moy, under
very exeeptioual circumstances, become acceptable to a nation. See

l. 15. [7.] toque adeo, dcc„ ‘and this, indeed, is not, 1 think, to be
wondered at.' ‘Adeo' is often used aiter pronomrs for the purpose oi
emphasizing them as subjecta. See Virg. Ecl. 4. 11, with Conington’s
note. Thus we have ‘ego adeo? ⁸1 sor my part,' like the Greek ἔγωγε.
‘Illum adeo morem: ‘that custom‚ by the way! Or possibly, as Kraner
suggests, the ¹ adeo' may belong to the ‘mirandum'

l. 17. [8.] qur virtute belli omnibus gentibus praeferebantur,
The terror which the name oi Gaul inspired at Rome has been already
noticed (1. 35, note 4); and how roughly the British Celts had handled .
Caesar we may judge from the fact that in starting on this campaign
Caesar's two legions which had just retumed from Britain contained
together only 7οοο men (chap. 49). When, therefore, Dr. Prichard
says (Hist. ol Mankind. vol. 3, p. 179) that the Celtic nations were

always defeated when they came into collision with the Germana, and η

when this fact is treated as a corroboration of the accounts ol their im·
morality, we ought to enquire whether Roman protectorates rather than

rational customs did not enseeble the Gauls and make them incapahle ol ¹

resistance. Such is Tacitus’ view (Agris. 11).
