l. 33. [7.] ut alacer est enimus, dcc. ‘as on the one hand the spirit
of the Gauls is prompt' &o . . . ‘so on the other hand, their intellect
is too slack and nerveless to bear up well against calamity!

P. 60. l 5. [o. 20. n. n] quae pers . . ex tertia perte, ‘which
section of Gaul is to be considered as a third of the whole country!
‘Ex tertia parte' means ‘on the footing of a third part: like ‘haeres
ex asse‚' ‘a sole legatee,’ ‘ex sacili: ‘easily' As to the exaggerated
size os Aquitania, we may remark that Caesar appears to have thought
that the Garonne has a general course running more to the northward
than it really has. He places Aquitania, in 1. 1, to the north-west oi
the Roman provinces: whereas its general position would be better
described by saying that it lies west and south-west oi the Provincia.
Itis true that this description is founded on the direction of the Upper
Garonne (see the note on 1. ι), but this would not sufficiently account

, ior the over estimate.

1. 8. [a] nanciscente annis ; hyperbaton; see ι. 6, note 3, and other
references in the index.

l. 8. [3.] Praeconinus, Mallium these had been generals sent
against Sertorius, ΒΕ, 78, and defeated by his lieutenants in Aquitania.

1.13. [4.] Tolosa, Narbone et Carcassone is the reading oi early
editions. The third name is omitted on the ground, first, that copu-
latives are not used to couple the second and third member only as in
English¹; and secondly‚ that Carcassonne became important only in the
middle ages The first reason would not cf itselsjustisy the omission
of ⁴ Carcassone‚’ as Caesar osten violates the rule stated, even when the
three substantives are strictly coordinata

l. 16. [5.] Sontietes3 the name (still remaining in the town of Sds)

appears to mean‘heroes.’ (See Gluck, Keltische Nomen, p. 155), and r

is Celtic, not Aquitaniam So the Bituriges oi Aquitania were Celts.

l. ao. [6.] ostenderunt, ‘they suddenly unmaslred their infantry!

1. ²3· [c. 21. n. n] positam·dependent'

l. 25. [a] adulescentulo duce, ‘when they had only a youthful
leader.’ The limiting adverb is often omitted in Latin, as in 1. 2. See
the last note on that chapter.

l. ογ. [3.] ex ttinere, ‘by simple escalade.'

1.30.[4.].10nge pontiseram superlative absoluto, ‘very skillul
indeed’ See note 1, on a, 8.

l. 31. [5.] aaronem secturae-‘copper mines? Some MSS. read¹
‘structurae' But though the expression ‘subterraneae structurae’ ·
occurs in Pliny (36. aa), ‘secturae’ is simpler. The ‘cuniculi’ were sor
¹the purpose oi destroying the embanlrments from beneath.

l. 3²· [6.] diligentia, See 1. 40, note 6.

² See Nipperdey’s Caesar, pp. 68, 69.
