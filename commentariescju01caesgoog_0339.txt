‘taran’ is Celtic for thunder. Mercury is Teutates¹ (Luw Taith, the
god of travellingt: and this name closely resembles the name oi Thoth,
by which the same divinhy, the author 01 311 arts, was known in the
East (Plato, Phaedr. 1 274). The god whom Caesar calls Mars was
Hesus. A figure oi him and one probably of Taranis are given from

a Grecian bnt an Etruscan and Roman goddess, her worship in Gaul
may have been of the same character as in those countries. She is, as
har name shows (⁶ menervo' being an old somn oi‘moneo'), the sug-
