‘mittit'

118. [1,] potiundi oppidi; the gerundive implies 01 course that
‘potior' may govem the accusative. So Ter. Adelph. 5. 4, 11,

‘miseriam ornnem ego capio. hic potitur gaudia?
So we have 'res fruenda oculis,’ ‘utenda vasa‚' and the like: but, aith
rare exceptione, this licence is used only in the case 01 the future in ‘dus'

‘vilicus litibus familiae supersedeat ι’ then probably ‘to sit over a

l. 6. [4.] loco pro castris, 811, ‘he chose a place before his camp
which lay near enough and was suitable ior forming a line of battle;
and, as the hill on which his camp was placed rose to 1 small height
from the plain, with just irontage enough 101 an army in battle array¹
and towards the front sloped gently back to the level after rising to a
slight emineoce, whilst its flanks were slightly precipimus, he carried
from each flank 01 the hill a ditch ending ina redoubt.’ It is difficult
to understand this passage clearly. The excavations seem to prove that
one 01 these ditches ran srom the south-east angle 01 the camp tc the
Alme, the other srom the north-west angle nearly to the Miette. But this
would be placing them both on the right of the position; whereas the
text seems to indicate that they guarded both flanks; and, taking it
alone, we should certainly think that they were drawn 11 right angles

, 10 the right and left 01 Caesar's line. and on both sides towards the

enemy. Perhaps the solution may be that the two ditches given in
plate 8 to Jules Cesar, together constituted the right-hand ditch 01 the
two mentioned by Caesar (their combined length would have been about
600 paceslt and another similar ditch (ellaced or not discovered) may
have been drawn at right angles to the leit os the position, crossing
110111 river to river, in a length 01 600 paces, as the eastern one did, by
¹the help 01 the intervening camp. The word ‘transversam’ seems 01
itseli to imply that the ditches crossed the axis 01 the hill.

l. 21. [0.9.11. 1.]11 nostri transirent, ‘to see il cutmen would cross
it ;’ so ubi neutri faciunt, ‘when it appeared that neither side would
take, the initiatae?
