cut his way through the snow of the Cevennes at midwinter3
his mode of bridging a large river like the Rhine, or passing a
smaller one in the face of the enemy (as he did the Allier iu 7. 3 5),
and above all, perhaps, his way of stimulating his soldiers, and re-
pressing discontent or mutiny, as in the well-known scene of 1. 40.
Over and above Caesar’s exploits, too, there are many singular
military feats of his lientenants, such as the defence of Qintus
Cicero’s camp against the Eburonians‚ and the various stratagema
of Labienus. Not the American civil war itself exhibits a stranger
and more picturesque variety of enterpn'se, or furnishes more
available hints to the military student than the Bellum Gallicum
of Caesar.

The late work of the Emperor Napoleon llI on the military
life of Caesar certainly deserves in a very high degree indeed the
gratitude of all students of the Commentaries. lt is true, of
course, that the Imperial writer was possessed of opportunities
and means of research into the topography of the various cam·
paigns such as no man ever had before him. But still, a careful
reader of his second volume will· not fail to see that these means
must have been of small avail‚ if they had not been directed
' and applied by a mind truly perceptive of the points at which
research was to be almed. We would take as an instance
of forcible military reasoning‚ even apart from research, the
arguments by which the locality of Caesar's battle with the
Usipetes is proved to have been near Cleves‚ and not anywhere

in the neighbourhood of Coblenz; for these rest more on broad
principles of strategy than on particular local investigation. But
it is when we can see the results of excavation that the full value

of the lmpen'al research becomes manifest. These include the
. discovery of Bibracte and the Gallie roads converging upon it;
the traces of Caesar’s camp on the Aisne, in Book 11 ; the fullest
possible illustration of the siege of Gergovia, and, above all, the
complete discovery of every relic that ages could possibly leave
of the siege of Alesia. Here we have the trace of all the camps,
the foundations ofthe redoubts, the drift gravel sent from the
rivers into the Roman ditcheS, the troas-de-Ioup made by the
besiegers still as fresh as on the first day, the caltrops anda
host of other similar antiquities discovered on the spot. finally,
at the exact points where the battle is stated by Caesar to have
