312 NOTES. BOOK VII, oHAP. 14.

1. 15. [a] ab initio, ‘froin the beginning’ ot this war.

1. ao. [3.] seseque ei dediderim, the result ot this surrender is not
indicated here, and other authors do not supply the blank. Was there
a ¹ sectio eius oppidi universa’ (see the similar case in a. 33), or did the
growing fierceness oi the conflict produce even fierccr mensures? The

omission oi all details makes us imagine that Caesar wished not to relate j

another tragedy like what he had to tell of Avaricum.

1. 21. [4] Avaricum ; for a plan of the town, s'ee Jules cesar (Plate

, ao), and sor the description, see vol. a, p. ²55·

1. aa. [5.] agri fertilissima ragione, ‘in the most fertile part of the
district occupied by them! ‘Regio’ properly means ‘a line drawn
from the eye onwards,' ‘a direction' <see above, 6. 25, note 3), and

secondarily, ‘a line bounding a space;' whence also ‘a space,’ ⁴ an area' ¹

1. 27. [o. 14. n. 1.] atque antea gestum sit, ‘from that in which it
had been managed before.¹ In the phrase ‘pariter patribus ac plebi
carus,’ we probably have to understand ‘carus’ aster ‘patribus’ So
we should write sully ‘illi sunt alio ingenio atque tu (alio).' Hence
‘atque' generally assumes the meaning ‘than'

l. 30. [a] quod tasi abundent, quasi-oblique: ‘because’ he said,
‘they had large numbers of cavalry?

l. 30. [3.] anni tempore, it was still March: and <a a) it was im-
possible to get even forage from the fields till June.

l. 31. [4.] necessario dispersos petere, &c., ‘were obliged to send
detached parties to get corn srom the houses.'

P. 142. l. 1. [5.] hoo spatio quoqueversus, &c., 'so far in all
directions as the enemy seemed likely to go sor soraging purposes.’

l. 6. [6.] a Boia. Scaliger enclosed these words in brackets; as the
meaning evidently is that the country should be laid waste round the
Romans wherever they were. Some editors have proposed to read ‘ab
hoste!

l. 6. [7.] ipsosne interficiant, if the former ‘ne' is omitted, the
second alternative is generally introduced by ‘ne' as in Horace's
question, ‘maiora minorane samal' If it is expressed it is mostly iol-
lowed by ‘an,’ as in the phrase, ‘servus esne an liber‚' or Cic. Att. 16. 8,
‘Romamne venio an hic maneo (an Arpinum ingiam ll!

l. 9. [8.] munitione, ‘by the strength of their fortifications' (1. 58,
note 4.)

l. 9. [9.] loni natura, ‘by the character os their site.¹

l.1o. [ro] nau Romanis proposita: see 4. 17, last note.

l.1a. [ιι] gravius aestimare, understand ‘se' ‘So he limatae
said, made much more account oi their wives being led into captivity,'
&a ⁸ Gravius‚’ as Rraner remarks, means ‘at a beavier rate!

l.1a.[12.] illa...in servitutem abstrahi coniuges. Caesar
