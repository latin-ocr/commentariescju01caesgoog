1. 33. [5.] nuntiarent ne, sor ‘mandatum perierrentss as in 3. 5, 4,
‘certiores facit paulisper proelium intermitterent!

1³. 70. 1, a. [o.12.n. 1.] ubi primum. . conspexerunt, ‘as soon as
ever they caught sight of our cavalry.¹ Note that if the cavalry had
gone in advance towards an enemy only twelve miles oli, before the
ambassadors'were dismissed with tidings of the truce, it is possible, to
say the least, that the German cavalry had not heard of the armistice.

1. 4. [a] non amplius octingentos. The numeral is govemed by
‘haberent' as if ‘ non amplius‘ were omitted.

l. 9. [3.] murus resistentibus, abl. absolute vyith subject omitted,
as in Livy 1. 37, ‘additur dolus, missis qui ligna in flumen coniice-
rent!

1. 14. [4.] Piso Aquitanas. From the similar case of C. Valerius
Procillus (1. 47) we may conclude that this Gallie chief had received a
Roman name along with citizenship: perhaps from the L. Piso men·

l. 15. [5.] regnum, ‘royal power,' as in 1. 3.

1. aa. [o. 18. n. L] hoo tacto proelio. ''fhis skirmish seems to have
strongly confirmed Caesar’s impression of the efficiency of the German
cavalry. See iv. a. His feeling appears to have been originally inspired
by Ariovistus’ horsemen (1. 48), whose organization he afterwards
imitated iu the battle of Pharsalia¹. He must have perceived that if
the main body of German cavalry now came up, he would soon find his
own Garis, if any further quarrel arose, absolutely useless in the field,
and a revolt of the whole country rising in his rear. Thus he resolved
to make ao enquiry whether the attack was excusable or not; and to
, consider the truce irrevocably broken. ἵ

1, 24. [a] per dolum atque insidias, a ¹prepositional adverb: as
'per summum dedecus' means ‘most disgraceiully! So ‘ex confesso:
‘confessedly :’ ‘de integro,’ ‘afresh ε’ ‘ad postremum,⁹ ‘finally'

l. 26. [3.] summae dementiae esse iudicabat exspectare: a good
reason for fighting at once ; if the truce was justly broken. in reciting
it, Caesar appears to betray the thoughts which really influenced him.

l. 31. [4.] ne quam diem pugnae, &c.‚ ‘so as not to let a day be
missed for fighting) ⁸ Pugnae' is genitive, as in the ordinary ‘tempus
committendi proelii! Both phrases would mean literally, according
to the accurate analysis oi the genitive case, ‘a time in ¹relation to
fighting:

1. 31. [5.] opportunissima res, ‘a aust fortunate accident ;’
