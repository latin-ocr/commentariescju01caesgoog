bank of the Rhone as lar as Culoz, and then gone by Amberieux to the
Saone at villefranche. Alter this they had occupied twenty days in
crossing the Saone; yet the crops ol the year were not sar advanced.

l. ²9· [3.] conferri, comportari, ‘that it was collecting and con·
veying to Caesar! ,

l. 31. [4.] frumentum metiri, ‘to give the soldiers their monthly
allowance os 50 lbs. oi com?

P. 1o.1. 1. [5.] quem vergobretum appellant, ⁴ the holder oi which
office they call the Guerg-breath’ (strong in judgment). We leam from
’ 7. 33, that the ‘vergobret' could not leave the state during his term ol
offioe: aud that uo one could be elected, if a living member oi his
family had held the post. It seems probable that the adjective ‘guerg’
is the origin of ¹ quercus' (the strong tree).

. 1. 4. [6.] tam necessario tempore, ‘at a time oi such urgency.’

1.6. [7.] multo etiam gravius, ‘with still greater vehemence.' The

punctuation in the text, which is that oi Krauer and Nipperdey, seems
undoubtedly correct. The common way oi expressing the same sense
would be ‘quo magis eorum precibus adductus bellum susceperit; eo
etiam &avius . . . queritur! The ‘et' before praesertim is omitted. as
in c. ²3· ‘eo magis quod proelium uon commisissent!
. t10.[o.17.n.1.]qu1 privatim plns possint: an unhallowed
alliance like that of Ap. Claudius Censor at Rome, between the high
aristocrats and the common people against the republican goverumeut.
See chap. a. note 1.

l.12.[a.] quod precatore debeant. The relative clearly should
agree with ‘frumentum’ ‘the corn¹ which they had to supply! It is
then better iu the next clause to read ‘praeferre' and translate ⁸ if they
could not occupy thrones themselves, they thought the dominion of
Gauls better than that of the Romans! ‘Praeferre' seems iu this case
to be the same as ‘priora habere? It is, however, possible that ⁴ per·
ferre malle' may be the true reading; there are obvious reasons why
the second word might have dropped out.

l.14. [3.] neque dubitare (debeant). lt seems plain that the last
word should be omitted, being a copyist repetition from the eud oi the
preceding clause.

l. 14. [4.] quin . . . siut ereptum the strong future subjunctive ior ·
which the present subjunctive ‘eripiant' might be substituted in a
lighter style.

l. 18. [5.] necessario . . .oosctus3 some MSS. and editions read
‘necessarium' apparently with the intention oi avoiding tautology. It
appears, however. simpler to translate ‘when he could not help it, and
on express compulsion’ Cp. Bell. Civ. 3. 49, ‘necessario loca sequi
demissa cogebantur: and Ter. Andr. 4.1.8, ‘tum coacti necessario se
aperiunt'
