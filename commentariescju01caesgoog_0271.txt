that his soldiers would mutiny! ’

suffered reverses and had been defeated, or their habits of peculation
had been brought clearly borneto them (⁸ convictam ⁹) by some flagrant
instance.¹ Caesaris referring, not to the celebrated mutinies of Roman
history (Liv a. 59, 4. 49, 28. 29), but to matters ol his own experience.

1. 23· [19.] quod . . collaturus fuisset, ‘he would do at once what
he should otherwise have put oli for some time! ‘Repraesentare' is a

1. 28. [ao] aum nola decima-legione. Observa the excellence os this
speech. It is quiet and ratiocinativa (and therefore, as given, almost
entirely retains the regular oblique tenses); yet the topics are of the
unquestionable character which alone can convince a blind panic.
After displaying these briefly but sully, he returns to his favourite mode
os thought and expression ;—there will be no mutiny, because he has
not deserved any (chap. 14, init), and he ends by a bold rhetorical

1. 10. [7.] aum iter non intermitteret, δια, ‘on the seventh day os
unbroken marching.' The ablative absolute would be the more natural
construction. See 1. 1, note 8.
