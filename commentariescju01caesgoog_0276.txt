‘For simple nations thefirst new light of the moou is most cheering and
joyful. From its appearance they also obtain the order of the months,
and, in the absence of astronomical observations, that of the whole civil
and religious year!

l. 33. [c.51.n.1.] omnis alarios. leaving in each camp a small
Roman force, Caesar drew up bis alarii (the auxilia of chap. 49) before
the smaller camp, in such a manner as to make it appear that the two
legions were there still. But, meanwhile, these legions had been with·
drawn‚ and crossing the space of three miles, unohserved by the enemy,
had joined the four legions belonging to the larger camp, and made an
- attack on Ariovistus’ position before he could call in his detachmeuts.
Of course the successful execution of such a stratagem depended largely
upon the perfect steadiness behind ramparts of the two legions who had
first occupied the'smaller camp (thus being left in the rear), and then
executed the hazardous movement from camp to camp. This explana·
tion is due to Jules Cesar, vol. a, p. 91.

P. 31. l. 1. [a] quodminus valebat. Thus Nipperdey and Kraner
wish to read, but for the more authorised reading ⁸ quo minus‚' see 4. a,

formation,¹ that is, one in dense bodies of from 300 to 400 men (Jules
Cesar, p. 92). Orosius' explanation is, that they formed a kind of
tortoise‚ with their shields over their heads; and that some of the
Roman soldiers sprang actually on this roof of shields. But this seems
improbable; for such a defensive arrangement would be suicidal as a
mode of resisting an attack with swords, although it might answer as
against javelins.

l. 21. [4] scuta manibus revellerent3 instead of following the
ordinary practice of pushing their shields under that of their enemy, and
wounding him from beneath (which they could do without abandoning
their own guard), they grasped the top of the euemies' shields aud
struck from above.
