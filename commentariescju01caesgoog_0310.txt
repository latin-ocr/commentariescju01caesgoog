Π so, a reference to the map will show that the passage must haye been
near Cologne or Bonn. Ol these the latter is probably the real spot; as
we may see by a comparison os the itinerary in 6. 29 foll, with the
present passage. On the character oi the bridge, see Merivale, vol 1,

Ἰ p. 461, note; on the difficulty oi constructing it by the labour of mere

legionaries, Hyde's Fortification, § 234.

1. ry. [a] ad septentriones vergit. The meaning seems to be the
same asin 1. 16, ‘Gallia sub septentrionibus posita est' ‘lies in a high
latitude:

l.18. [3.]proficisoi contendit. dcc, ‘arranged to go into Britain:
Compare tbe sense of the words bere with matos those in 1. 23, 1. ⁵3·

l. 23, [4.] Gallie mant incognite: the chief trade with Britain was
in the hands os the Veneti; and they, according to Strabo (4. 271), were
anxioustothwart the expedition. Hence probably anassumed ignorauce.

l. 29. [5.] quem usum belli, ‘what degree oi practice in war)

l. 3²· [c. 21. n. r.] periculum lacera ‘to make a trial! This sense
results literally from the derivation. Compare the sense ol ⁴ peritus!

P. 75. 1. a. [a] in Mor-tuom this nation extends as far up as the

Scheldt; but the ‘brevissimus traiectus’ indicates that Caesar chose the
Strait of Dover for this passage. As to the portali later authorities
are agreed that it could only bave been GessoriacumtBonlogne). For
this port was universally used ior embarkations to Britain rmder the
emperors; it is the only one which has subsidiary ports at the dis-
tances mentioned by Caesam it was the harbour to which the military
roads led (see Bertrand‚ Vcies Romaines‚· pp. 5, 6); and, finally, it is
the only port anywhere near the Strait oi Dover which could hold fleets
of anything lilre the sire which Caesar collected there ¹. See the map at
P· 75·
l. 8. [3.] polliceantur· obsides dare: the future inf. is used in the
next chapter with ‘polliceon’ Euphony would be against it in this
passage. For the verb, see 1. 4²· note 3, which justifies the tense here
used; as ‘pollicer’ originally means ‘to put sorward’ ⁴
