word‘ impossible‚' like Napoleon‚ who said, ‘Impossiblel ne me dites
jamais cette bete de mot!

l. ao. [5.] pro loci natura, ‘considering the character os the scene oi
action?

l. 25. [6.] ventus coepisset et se vento dedissent. Cp. 1. 8, note
3, (⁴ ei’ ior ‘vento' would have been inelegant; especially as ‘vento se
dare' is a well-known phrase).

l. 28. [7.] quarum rerum . ..casua ‘whereas our ships had to sear
all these contingent perils.’

l. 51. [c. 14. n. 1.] statuit exspectandam olassem, ‘he made up his
mind that he must wait sor his fleet'

l. 3²· [a] quas ubi convenit; they appear to have sallied from the
river Auray as soon as the approach oi the Romans srom the Loire was
signalled to them. The battle took plaoe in the bay oi Quiberon, and
was viewed by' Caesar irom the heights oi S. Gildas. Considering the
superiority uf the Breton fleet in number and equipment, this victory os
the Romans is a real master-stroke. The defeat of the expedition sent
from England under Puisaye in 1795 has attached. as regards ourselves,
very different memories to the same spot.

1. 3²· [3.] primum understand ‘ubi' ‘ as soon as it was seen by the
enemy!

Ρ. 57. l. 3. [4] quibus. ..naves erunt attributae, ‘who had taken

l. 7. [8.] ex inferiore loco; since. on the one hand, the place srorn
which they were cast was so much lower; (for this prepositional abl.
absolute, see 1. 33, note 3), and, on the other, those sent by the Gauls
fell more heavily. Considering the weight os a Roman javelin, it is
evident that it must have made the greatest possible difference whether
gravity acted sor or against it. ,

l. 9. [9.] una erat magno usui ren Caesar really means to say that
without these hooks the battle would not have been won (cp. 7. 41):
but the Roman military instinct avoids even the remotest suggestion oi
possible deleat or iailure.

l. 11. [1o.] non absimili forma muralium falciumr understand ‘ior-
mae.’ The ‘murales saloes' were used sor pulling down an enemy's turs wall.
