l. aa. [4.] sl vim facere conarentur, a remote supposition, ‘ii they
were to attempt the passage by force! ‘Navibus junctis' seems to mean
‘by making bridges ol boats.⁸

l. 28. [o.9.n.1.] una per Sequanos vie. Being unable to force
their way at once into the province, they resolved to try the north bank
ol the Rhone, by the former of the-two ways described above.

l. 30. [a] sue sponte. lf this word is, as Donaldson supposes, a
collateral form ol ‘pondus’ we can see how the idea ol ‘ by their own

1. 30. [o. 11. n. a] ita ee de populo Romano meritos. Kraner

Arverni as ‘ausi Latio se fingere fratres

Sanguine ab Iliaco populi.¹
He perhaps conlounds the Arverni with the Aedui: and the legend was
