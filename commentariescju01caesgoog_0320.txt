Man, p. 388) tells us, it is true, of a somewhut similar arrangement among
the Tabitians. ‘A considerable number,’ he says, ‘oi the principal
people were formed into an associa-tion called the '‘Arreoy.” all the
members oi which were regarded as being married to one another, If
any of the women os the society had a child, it was almost invariably
killed; ii it was allowed to live. the father and mother were regarded as
having definitively engaged themselves to one another, aad were ejected·
from the associati0n3 the woman being henceiorth known as a “bearer
oi children;'' which was among this extraordinary people a term of·
reproach! This practice, then, was evidently intended to repress‚
from natural causes, the birth of children. Can it be possible that,
if a custom at all like it had been extensively prevalent in Britain, there
would have been-in the island the ‘infinita multitudo hominum’ which
Caesar describes. See, ior the arguments on the other side, the Pict.

expectation, and a slight but graphic touch of British character (now as
