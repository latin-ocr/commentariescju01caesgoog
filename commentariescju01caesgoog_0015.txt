X INTRODUOTION.

and point by means of short sentences, asin the closing scenes
of the siege of Alesia in Book VII. ln fact, it uses iu a somewhat
less developed form than after-writers all the resources oi Roman
style; and this with the additional excellence that the expression
never seems to be sought soron its own account, but always
to be the natural outgrowth of the facts narrated. indeed, a
scholar whose taste is formed upon Caesar's writings does not

find anything afterwards in Roman historical writers which
pleases him so well. Assuming the view that the Latin language
is suited by its inward character to be more than any other the
organ of expression for the true and actual, and that it never
works with such natural ease as when it is stating facts in the ’
genuine or'der of their occurrence, one cannot help feeling that
Caesar has more nearly' than any other writer been ableto
realise this ideal. Whether he turns out on closer examination
tohave been perfectly scrupulous or not, it can hardly be denied
that in proportion as a historical writer is scrupulouslycandid
a'nd truthful, so will his style approximate to that employed by
Caesar. ’ ”
Does' this excellence then¹ really imply an unusual amount of
candour in the historiari, or was it simply the result of his consum· '
mate art? This is a point in some degree hard to decide,'and
one on which opinions will certainly differ. The view taken-in Ι
the notes to this edition upon this particular point may be briefly '
summed up as follows :—Caesar possesses in the fidlest degree
the Roman habit of stating everything in a disadvantageous
light for his enemies: thus he makes no mention of the manifold
κ provocations which the Helvetii received from Roman marauding
parties even in times of peace3 nor does he think it necessary
to dwell on the fact that the Romans, in view of the Helvetic
invasion, had made an alliance with Ariovistus, and thus guaran-
teed to him the tranquil possession of his conquests in Gaul;
in fact, he covers these inconvenient facts by a rhetoric so
shilful that it has constantly passed for simplicity and truth-
fulness. In the case of the Usipetes and Tenctheri he
disguises‚ almost beyond the necessity of the case, the fact
that his only chance of safety lay in attacking the Germans
before their detached cavalry returned. So again in 'the British
expeditions, he manages his 'narration so skilfully that we do not,
