NOTES. BOOK Ι, CHAP. 34· 227

l. 30. [a] fratres saepenumero appellatos: see Merivale, Hist.
Rom. vpl. 1, p. 133, and above, chap 11, note 1.

l. 33. [3.] in tanto imperio, ⁶ while the empire of the Roman people
was so great;’ the prepositional ablative absolute used, as the verb
‘sum' has no participle. So Sallust uses the two phrases ‘perditis
rebus,’ and ‘in extremis rebus,' with the same meaning. So also we
have in Cic. Off. 2, ‘uti in re non dubia testibus non necessariis,'
witnesses being unneccssary when the case was so certain: and Liv.
31· 36, ‘ex tam propinquis stativis parum tuta frumentatio erat,' us the
camps were so near one another, foraging was unsafe,

P. 20. 1. 5. [4.] homines feros ac barbaros, as in ehap. 2, note 6.

1. 9. [5.] Rhodanus divideret, ‘only the Rhone divided,’ asin chap.
a, note 9.

l. 9. [6.] quibus rebus, which danger should, he thought, be met as
soon as possible. ’

l.11. [7.] arrogantiam sumpserat. Caesar here sums up with

' admirable brevity the grounds which induced him to go to war with

Ariovistus. To complete the view ol the status, some other facts, how-
ever, must be talren into account. The Sequani had originally attached
the Aedui (and called in Ariovistus to their help), because of the tyranny
exercised by them in laying exeessive tolls on the dried meat trade of
the Saone mentioned above. Shortly after this battle, in B.C. 61, the
Roman senate, in order to guard against the expected Helvetian in·
vasion, had sent messengers to the chief Gallie cities to induce them to
oppose it; and in pursuance of this object had passed the decree sor the
protection of the Aedui and· other allied states, to which Caesar refers
in chap. 35, a step which, taken, so late as it was, showed but little
‘fraternal' affection (Cic, ad Att. 1. 18). At the same moment, and with
the same object, they sent confidential messengers to Ariovistus, saluting
him as ‘rex et populi Romani amicus,' recognising thus his claims on
Gaul, and according to Plutarch, inviting him to Rome (Vita Caes. 19).
In this manner: they persuaded him not to favour the Helvetian invasion3
but their duplicity in allying themselves with oppressed and oppressor
at once led to its natural consequences in the war now to be
narrated.

l.13. [c. ³4. n.1.] locum medium utriusque, ‘some neutral
spot’

l. 14. [a] summis utriusque rebus, ‘matters of high importanee to
both of them’ (⁶ quae summo opere utriusque intersint ').

1. 16. [3.] si quid ipsi, a model sentence for reflexive and determina·
tive pronouns. The reflexives (referring to Ariovistus) are ‘ipse' in the
nominative aud dative,“se' and ‘sese’ in the accusative the deter-
minatives referring to Caesar are ·i11e‚' ‘illum’ ‘eum' The last ‘illum'
might be elegantly omitted, as it is in some editions.
