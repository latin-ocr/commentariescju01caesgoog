P. 71.1. a. [6.] contra atque esset dictum, 'contrary to what they
had stated ;’ 'atque' is the same as ‘ac' or ‘quarm’ ‘contra quum
ipse censuisset? Cic. Pis. 8.18.

1. 5. [7.] quos ..illos retineri iussit. Kraner thinks that th'e
unusual ‘illos' is inserted in opposition to ‘ipse' ¹ he ordered them to
be detained, while he himself . .’ More probably the second pronoun
is introduced to mark the succession oi events, as after the abl. absolute
in 7. 4, ‘Vercingetorix convocatis suis clientibus facile (eos) incendit!

l. ιο. [o. 14. n. 1.] omnibus rebus, (by the whole state ot affairs}
1. 4, note 1.

l. 11. [a] discessu suorum, ‘by the withdrawal of their chiess.’

1. 12. [3.] perturbantur· copiasne ducere praestarem a pregnant
construction understauding ‘dubitatione’ just as in the phrase ‘quid
istic fiat, nou laboro‚' ‘sollicitudine’ is implied.

l. 13. [4.] ne . . an. . an 3 otherwise. in triple disjunctive questions,
‘utrum¹..¹ne'..‘an,’-‘utrum’..‘an’..⁴an,'and‘ne’..‘an’witb
the first conjunction omittedp the last form being the lightest and most
elegant! '

l. πο. [5.] mquos ..equitatum misit. This incredible barbarity‚
together with the cancelling of the truce, caused Cato’s celebrated
outburst in the Roman senate, ou the proposal of a ‘supplicatio'
for this victory (Plut. Caes. 22). Caesar, he declared, ought to be
delivered up to the Tenchteri‚ as an expiation sor his atrocious perfidy
to them.

l. 28. [o. 15,n.1.] ex tanti belli timore, ‘great though the appre-
hended scale of the war had been! The prepositiou ‘ex’ is here a
substitute sor a concessive abl. absolute: just as 'in tanto imperio
populi Romani' in 1. 33, note 3, is equivalent to a causative. See also
2. aa, note 2.

l. 3ο. [a] discedendi potestatam feeit. Caesar's sparing the
senate may be held a sufficient proof that he did not really consider
them guilty of the charge he makes against them. Compare his dif-
ferent treatment of the Breton senate, whom be did think guilty (3. 16),
though he admits that they were so only on compulsion.

l. 31. [3.] supplicia Gallorum veriti. Was the ‘auctoritas apud
Gallos,’ ol chap. ῐ3, consistent with the fact of these ravages‚ and with
the further consequences which Caesar's defeat would have entailed on
the Gaulsi

P. 72. l. 3. [o. 16. n.1.] iustissima eausa, ‘the most decisive
cause! .

l. 5. [a] eum inunguerenu a hypothetical future cause. ‘He
wished them to sear sor= their own affairs, by being made quite aware
that the Romans could cross the Rhine.’

L 7. [3.] commemoravi. Aska writer: Caesar veils his personality
