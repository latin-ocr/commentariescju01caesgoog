216 noras. noer 1, errae. ig 14

l.3r.[o.13.n.1.] pontem faniendmn curat. Lit. ‘he takes care
os a bridge, as in the way of making.¹ Hence the double meaning,
active and passive, of the future in ‘ dus,' as shewn in ,⁴ secundus’ on the
one hand and ‘amandus' on the other. So iu Greek wc have nsvcrds,
dromos, and a few other verbals in an active as well as a passive sense.

P. 8. l. 1. [a] ut flumen transirent, in apposition with ⁸ id'

· l. 6. [3.] ubi eos caesar constituisset. Divico’s words, stated
directly, would have been ‘ubi nos constitueris,’ in the future perfect.
1.11.[4.]ant ipsos despiceret. This pronoun refers distinctly to
the Helvetii, the ‘suae' to Caesar, the subject. Cp. c. 40, ‘ cur de sua
virtute aut de ipsius diligentia desperarent l’

l.13. [5.] magis virtute (contenderent), dre.. ⁸that they had been
so instructed as rather (to do their work) by valour, than make their
way by artifice, or rely on ambuseades.’ (Zeugma.)

l. 14. [6.] ne committeret, δια, ‘let him not so act, that the place
on which they stobd should bear a name or hand down a tradition from
an overthrow of the Roman people, and the destruction of their army!

l. 19. [o. 14. n. 1.] quo minus marito populi Romani medimna,
‘because they had been so little deserved hythe Roman people!

l. ao. [a] qui st alieuius iniuriae conscius Μυοῦς an ordinary
and characteristic expression os Roman diplomacy, which always made
e point oi professing its own purity, (much as Achilles in the Iliad
assures his friends that it is n grave mistake to imagine that he loves
war). Thus in the Tiburtina inscription (engraved during the Samnite
wars), the Senate accepts in the following terms a disclaimer of that
people; ‘Ea nos animum nostrum non inducebamus ita sacta esse, quod
seibamns ea vos merito nostm facere aon poera'sse.¹ In the case of the
Helvetii the missing ‘injuria’ might have been found, il the history
os Roman kidnapping parties in the Alps eould have been written.

1. 21. [3.] non fuisse difficile cavere, the oblique sorm os the direct .

‘non erat difficile cavere? ‘it would not have been difficolt! So Cic. de
Inv. a. 135, ‘non fuisse grave nec difficile‚’ and below, in 5. 29, we have-
‘venturos esse,' as the oblique of ‘ venturi erant’ In phrases expressing
necessity, possibility, difficulty, aare, right, wrong, and desirableness, the
conditionale are mostly expressed in this absolute way. Thus we say
‘par erat,' sor ‘it would have been right· ‘quanto melius fuerat} how
‘much better would it haye been.¹ See chap. 3, note 5, sor the
applicetion os this principle to the word ‘possum' and Jetr’s Greek
Grammar, 858. 3, sor the omission of dr in the corresponding Greek
hrases.
Ι)1. ²4· [4.] num memoriam deponere posset the oblique form oi
‘can 1 lay nsidel’ See the last notes oi 5. 28 and 5. ²⁹· The
infinitiva form in oblique interrogatives marks that the question is in
the first or third person, the conjunctive that it is in the second persen.
