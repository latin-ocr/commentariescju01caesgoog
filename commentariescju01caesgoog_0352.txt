the form of the expression to denote the'likelihood of the supposition.
This probability is however expressed only in the following words,
‘quae sit necesse accidere victis! Just so Cic. Leg. Man. 26, has
first, ‘Quid tam inauditum, quam equitem Romanum triumphare? at
eam quoque rem populus Romanus . . . videt,' and then, a few lines on,
where the turn of the phrase implies‚ without any addition, the occur·
rence of the fact, ‘at quid tam incredibile quam ut eques Romanus
triumpharet?

1. 14. [13] quae sit necesse accidere, ¹ and this, he said, must neces·
sarily hoppen to thern if conquered.'

l. 15. [o. 15. n. r.] emplius viginti nrbes: see4.1a, a.

. l. 19. [a] explorata victoria: see a. 4, note 5.

l. aa. [3.] pulcherrimam urbem ; Avaricum was on the site of the
present Bourges; but occupied more ground, as it contained rocco
inhabitants. It was celebrated for its squares and open public places.

1. ²4· [4.] loni namma, ‘from the character of its site.¹ It was sur·
rounded on all sides but that towards Moulins by marshes, which have
now shrunk into the channels of the thre, Yevrette, and Auron. Its
position was therefore like that of Shrewsbury or Durham; in a kind of
loop with abrupt descents towards the streame. Moreover the neck of
land between the marshes, by which it communicated with the adjoining
country, was cut by a deep ravine, the bottom of which was eighty feet
below the erest of the wall in that directior.

1. 28. [5.] precibus . . . misericordia, ablativus normae; like ‘insti-
tuto suo,' &c See 1. 4. a.

l. 30. [o. 16. n.1.] Gaesarem subsequitur. Vercingetorix, after
hanging on the left of Caesar's march, had established himself pro·
bably near Dun le Roi, so as to draw his supplies from the Arvemian
country.

P. 14³. l. a. [a] dispersos adoriebatur, 'attached the men while
scattered.’ Compare the wise policy of Cassivelaunus (5. 19).

l. 4. [3.] ab nostris occurrebatur, &c., ‘although as much as could
be done by calculation was accomplished by our rnen to remedy the
difficulty by going (namely that they went) at various hours of the
day!

1. 5. [4.] ut iretur appears to be in apposition with ‘quantum'

l.13.[o.17. n. 1.] alteri non magnis facultatibus, understand
‘cum essent.¹ See 1. 18, note a; and 1. 39, note 2.

1. 18. [a] extremam famem sustentarent, ‘bore up against exces-
sive hunger! The imperfect subjunctive here marks that the con-
sumption of cattle lasted all through the time during which the supply
of corn was short. ln Bell. Civ. i. 48, Caesar calls meat a ‘secundum
subsidium* for the comdiet to which the soldiers were accustomed.

l. 21. [3.] in opere, ‘legions engaged in the work.‘
