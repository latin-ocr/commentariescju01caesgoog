noras, noos ι, care. 43. 233

1. 18. [3.] polliceretur. The literal sense of this compound must be
gained from that os the simple ‘liceor’ (chop. 18, note 3). According
to this ‘proliceor’ would mean ‘to leave (or allow) lorwerd from one
sels} that is. ‘to offer!

1. 18. [4.] in spem veniebat, ‘he began to entertain hope.’

l. ro. [5.] fore uti desisteret; chap. 10, note a.

l. 22. [6.] ultro citroque, ‘backwards and forwerds! Mr. Long has
well remarked that this phrase proves that ‘ultro' is connected with
‘ultra’ and not immediately with the verb 'volo'

l. 25. [7.] uterque veniret3 chap. 36, note .7.

1, 26. [8.] interposita oense, ‘by allowing difficulties or excuses to
intervene’

l. 31. [9.] quarn amicissimum, δια, ‘guarda as devoted as possible!

l. 31.[1o.] si quid opus facto essem this appears to be a mixture
of the two common constructions ‘si quid opus est‚' is anything is
needsul (anecd), and ‘si sacto (or factu) opus est‚’ is there is need of
action. Observe that 'quid' alone is the subject, ‘ opns' the predicate.

P. 26. 1. r. [11.] cohors praetoria, ‘the cohort oi the praetorium:
that is, of head-quarters. They were to supply the guerds end escorts
required by Caesar.

l. a. [ra] ad equum recumbere, ‘he was making them knights on
horseback.' The joke is more pointed in Latin. Mr. Long remarks
on the difficulty os making men riders extempore ; bnt Vegetius (1. 18)
asserts that, even up to his time, ‘salitio equorum non tironibus modo,
sedetiam militibus districte est semper exsucta.¹ The context shews
that he means infantry. Is we suppose that Vegetius, as in some other
cases. is here drawing on his own imagination. the leat of the Germans
in teaching navvies to ride adequately in three days for the purpose of
blowing down the bridge at Bitche is a notable instance of the possi·
bility ol doing what Caesar does here.

l. a. [o.43.n.1.] planicies magne. Caesar made a rapid march
from Tonnerre to Besanpon (chop. 38). Then, avoiding the mountainous
and wooded country on the direct line by Montbeliard, he went by a
detonr os fisty miles by Pennesieres and Vallerois les Bois to Arcey.
At this place, aster sour days' march, hc resumed the direct road to the
Rhine by Bellort, as sar as Cemay. Arriving there on the 7th day
’ he found himself within twenty-four miles of Ariovistus. who was en-
camped near Colmar. The plain was the one crossed by the rivers
111 and Thur.

l. ro. [a] sue senatusque beneficis; chap. 33, note 5.

l.12.[3.] munere amplissime, ‘giits os the most dignified cha·
recten? Livy, 30. 15, tells us that these gists consisted of a golden
crown and cup, an ivory curule chair and sceptre‚ and embroidered
robes.
