noras. nourr νη, enar. 11-1-3. 311

1. 28. [o. 10. n. r.] stipendiariis expugnationis he allowed the tribu·
taries of the Aedui to be captured’ Caesar had noticed, in 6. 11, that
the first duty of a leader‚ according to Gallie opinion, was to secure his
dependents.

1. 29. [a] in eo: see 1. 5, note 5. ‘In se’ would have meant ‘in
themselves’here. ’

1. 31. [3.] ab re frumentariae see 3. 25. note 4.

P. 140. 1. 5, [o. 11. n. r.] altero die, the order ol days, when the
ablative os time is used, is primo, altero, tertio (Cic. Phil. 13. 13). This
rule does not however apply to ¹ post tertium diem,' and the like: see
4. 9. note134. 28, note 1.

l. 6. [r.] Vellaunodunum: sufficient Gallie remains have been dis-
covered to fir the site of this town at 'lugubres near the road from Sens
to Gien and Orleam.

1. 7. [3.] expeditiore ra trum0ntaria meretum in order that it might
be possible to bring up his convoys (Litotes).

1.12. [4.] conabum, almost certainly Gien‚ and not Orleans‚ as
commonly* thought. Caesar's object was to be as soon as possible
at Gorgobina; to go to Orleans would have been sixty miles round,
and would have involved the passage os marshes and foreste. Besides
this, the direct road from Sens to Orleans did not exist in Caesar's time.

1. 17. [5.] diei temporo exclusus, dre.. ‘he was hindered srom further
operation by the lateness os the honr!

1. 19. [a] pons continebat, a bridge was in the immediate rear os
the town.

1. 25. [7.] perpaucis desideratis. Here the circumstance expressed
by the ablative absolute accompanies or follows the main action instead
os preceding it. So Livy 4. ro, ‘Volsci oppressi dederunt poenas, vix
nuntio caedis relicto,¹ This is rare.

l. ²7· [ .] oppidum diripit, from the horrid fate of Avaricum
presently we cau judge what is included in this expression.

1. 32. [o. 12. n. r.] Noviodunum this cannot mean Navem, since
the place indicated must be about halsway between Gorgobina and
Ι(Ξίειι. It has therefore been fixed at Sancerre‚ where there still romain

- the substructures of a large Gallie city.

1. 33. [r.] ut eibi ignoscerem the reflexive refers bach to ‘legati’
The meaning of the verb excludes all ambiguity.

P. 141. l. 1. [3.] celeritate, δια, ‘with the same rapidity with which
he had accomplished the rest os his objects.' The rapidity of the
sentence is aided by the asyndeton.

l. 10. [4.] ex significatione, ⁴ from the demeanour' os the Gauis.

1. 14.[o.13. n. r.] Germanoa3 here we see the sruit of Caesar's
glowing description of the German cavalry in 1. 48. Vercingetorix
ty. 18) also adopted the German cavalry tactics.
