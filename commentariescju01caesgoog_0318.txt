worse. eoos w, erma 10-12: 279

i. 15. [6.]100um munitum a breastwork such as was osten made
in a iew hours in the American civil war by cutting down trees ancl
making them sall so as to form salient angles.

1. 20. [7.] testudine iectu the legions had now work in which they
were quite at home. lacking their shields, so as to sorm a roos over
¹their heads; and thus bringing up earth enough to form an embank·
ment, they soon stormed the work. The seventh legion was the one
which had been so roughly handled in the last year's campaign. .

l. 26. [o. 10. n.1.] in expeditionem, ‘as a flying column!

1³. 89. l. 1. [2.] incommodum see 1. 18, note 8.

l. 6. [o. 11.n.1.] sebeon as the engineer corps in the Roman army
seems to lrave been separate irorn the legions (Orelli, Inscr. a, p. 96), it
is probable that volunteers who happened to understand carpenter’s
work were here called sor.

l. 8. [2.] iis legionibus: see 1. 8, note r.

l. 19. [3.] cassivellauno. The presence ol such an enemy as Caesar
made thern sorget their civil broils‚ and ior the time Caswallon (first
of the roll ot' English heroes) was accepted as general even by his
bitterest enemies, the Trinobantes

1. ao. [4.] a mari milia passuum Lm, that is, eighty miles from
the sea at Romney.

1.25. [o. 12. n. r.] Britanniae pars interior. Caesar's object in
writing these details about Britain is indicated by the curiosity which
enlightened men at Rome seit about the island. Thus Cicero writes to
his brother Quintus, who commanded one of Caesar's legions, ‘modo
mihi date Britanniam quam pingam coloribus tuis penicillo meo. . . .·
Quos tu situs, quas naturas rerum et locorum, quos mores, quas gentes,
quas pugnas habes' (Ad Quint. a. 15, 16). Compare for the similarly
enlightened curiosity about America at the time oi its discovery, Pres-
cott, Ferd. and Isabella, vol. a, p. 106.

l. 25. [2.] natos in insula, rather the earliest Celtic immigrants.

The existence os an earlier Iberian populationis certain, on grounds of
comparative anatomy: but Celtic names occupy even the western parts
of England, where the Iberian population has lasted longest.
v 1. 27. [3.] ex Belgio. The identical names alluded io by Caesar are
the Atrebates, Belgae (and Parisii). See lathem, Ethn. of the British
Islands, p. 70. There were no Cantii Trinobantes, nor Regni in Gault
but the names of towns on the two sides ol the charmel are so similar,
that Caesar is probably accurate in stating that the origin oi these tribes
was Belgian. , ·

l. 30. [4.] hominum, ⁸ oi the population!

P. 90. l. r. [5.] plumbum album, ‘tin' It seems obvious that
Caesar must have meant the tin mines to be on the coast, the iron
works in the central districts.
