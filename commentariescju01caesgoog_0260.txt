l. 32. [· .] legatum pro praetore, propraetor and ¹lienteriam-general
commanding a legion.

l. 33. [5.] lis duoibus, qul iter amoverent, ⁴ using as guides the
same persons whom he had sent to reconnoitre the way!

Ψ. 18. 1. 1. [6,] qnid sni consilii, like ‘nihil reliqni,' in chap. 11, and
‘nec quidquam iis pensi est‚' Liv. 34. 49. Observe Caeser’s effective
method in narrating. He states here only that he gave Labienus his
orders: what these orders were, the sequel brings out in a more te'lling
way than a detailed account of the orders as given would do.

l. 10. [o. 22. n. r.] equo admisso, ‘with his horse at tuti
speed! ·

bra. [a] insignibus namara, the devices on their shields and
helmets. Observe that ‘Gallio’ is equivalent to ‘Helvetian' here.
'ilie insereuce which Caesar drew from Considins’ information was, that
Labienus had been repulsed, perhaps destroyed; and that he must
expectari attack at once.

l. 1¹8. [3.] malbodio, ‘when the day was murt: that ἧς,ί lar advanced!

1. πο. [4.] qnod non vidisset, pro vieo, an amount os bewilderment
hard to imagine.¹ Was Caesar always generous in his account ot the
proceedings of liis subordinates? He certainly does not spare Cotta
and Sabinus in ι5. ²9 soll: yet a general now-a-days would hardly blame
so violently officers who had paid for their fault with their lives. But
cp. Chesney's Campaign in Virginia (vola. p. 65), where Napoleon,
'Frederic the Great, and Wellington are compared as regards this point.

1. aa. [5.] ¹milia passuum tria 3 just lilre the phrase ⁸ hasta sex pedes
'longa’ ‘a lance (to) six ieet in length? so a distance may be expressed

· ' as extending to six miles-and therefore by the accusative case. On the

donn ‘milia’ *see 8. 4, note π.

l. 24. [o.23.n.1.] postridie eius dien ‘posteri' is the ablativo
agreeing with ‘die' (cp. postea, and antea). Tho pleonasm ol ‘diei' is
like ‘perfacile sactu esse probat conata perficere’ in chap. 3.

l. 24. [a] biduum is an abridgement of ‘bidivum.' When this is
reduced toa dissyllable, the first syllable becomes long by position.

l. 28. [3.] iter avertit, asyndeton: ‘'he therefore turned his march
aeide!

l. ²9· [4.] Bibracte. The main road pursued by the Helvetii would
have lest a little on 'the right this city, -so celebrated as the druidieel
capital of Gaul. Its ancient name still remains in the Mont Beuvray‚
which appears, by recent excavations1, to have been its site. On the
peculiarity of its position lor a capital, seeJules cesar, vol. a. p. 67,

² These excasations have discovered the traces of numerous Gallie reads,
all converging upon Mont Bwsruy, aethe roads leading to a capital would
naturally have done.
