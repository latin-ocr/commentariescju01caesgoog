l, 2¹6. [5.] circiter milis septem. If there is no error in Mr. Lewin's
calculations (which have been followed throughout the preceding notes),
Caesar now lands at a point about seven Roman miles west of Dover,
that is, at Lymne in Romney marsh where, at a distance of about two
vmiles from the present beach, may be seen the old line of chffs and
the ruins of the Roman port. Mr. lewin's work gives some interesting
mediaeval maps, showing the stare of Lymne at different times.

l. 28. [o. 24. n. 1.] quo genere, ‘which two arms!

Ρ. 77. l. 1. [a] oppressis is dative agreeing with ‘militibus’

1. 7. [3,] pedestribus proeliis, ‘in battles by land?

1.10. [o. 25. n. 1.] ad latus apertum on the right flank which is
unprotected by the shields of the men. ’

l. 15. [a] paulum modo, '⁸ though only for a short distance‚’ ¹ just
for a little?

l. 17. [3.] qui aquilam ferebat. Out of each maniple the centurions
chose two of the strongest and brevest soldiers as‘signiferi,' like our
colom-sergeants, ermept that they carried the eagle.

1. ²3. [4.] ex proximis navibus, ‘from the nearest ships of the tirst line’
¹l. 27. [o. 2d. n. 1.] firmiter insistere, ‘to take ground steadily.’

l. 30. [a] singulares, ‘in small gr·oups‚' so ‘singillatim' in 3. a, for
‘in small parties.·’

P. 78. l. 1. [3,] speculatoria navigia, ‘some of his small repeating ’
vessels)

l 5. [4.] equites sursum tenere non potueram the cavalry on
board the eighteen transports, who had been left behind at Ambleteuse‚
and there westherbound.

l. 7. [5.] sd pristinam fortunam defuit3 almost unawares Caesar
seems here to admit that his fortune was now changing. 111 fact, a tide
of disasters was now setting in to continue for several years.

1.19.[0.27.]s1ne ceusu why interfere with such a harmless
military promenade? So in c. 30 these untoward barbarians make a
‘rebellio’ a ‘conjuratio'

l. 25. [o. 28. n. a] post :diem quartum as the date of Aug. arth
assumed above for Caesar's landing depends on these words, it is
necessary to be sure of their meaning. This is exactly parallel with
that of ‘ante diem quartum,’ which is well known to mean ‘three days
before‚' a phrase so completely established, that Latin writers (e g. Cic.
Phil. 3. 8) use the three words as if they were one substantive-⁶ in a. d iv.
Kal. Dec. distulit! The parallelism may be proved by Cic. de Div. 1.
25, where ‘post diem tertium’ is a rendering of Plato's ἤματι τριτάτῳ
(Crit. 43 D), which from the context in Plato necessarily means ‘the
day after to·morrow,' as Socrates is arguing that the Theoric vessel will
arrive only on the morrow, and therefore he will have to die only on
the following day. So above in 4. 9, the same expression is used for
