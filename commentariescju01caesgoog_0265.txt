l. 21. [13] neque eonferendum esse, dre.. ‘the soil oi Gaul was too

generally uses the expression ‘conferre parva maguis, minima cum
maximis‚' διε.. yet iu Tusc. 1. 1, ‘quae natura, non literis, assecuti sunt

1. ²3- [14] bauo cousuetudinem metue. Divitiacus said, ‘haec

l. 25. [ry] Magetobrigaa ‘the great mountain,’ (from ‘ maith' the -

1. η. [18.] exempla ouantesque, ‘all kinds of punishments and
tonneuts;' cp. Tacit. hun. 12. ao, ‘meritum novissima exempla Mith-

1. 3ο. [19.] niel ei quid auxilii sit, ‘unless¹ indeed, they could
obtain some help? a modest or remote supposition. So Cic. Cat. a. 4,

1. 28. [c. 38. n. 1.] secundum ea, διο.. ‘besides these considerations

from the future iu ‘moribundus’ ¹ gemebundus,' &c
