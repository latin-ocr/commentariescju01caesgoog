raged most hemely, the French officers employed have found
vast numbers of arrow-heads‚ and even the coins which fell in
quantities from the slain ou that terrible day. Nor should the
curious discovery at Uxellodunum be‘left unmentioned, where
the -very face of the ground, which had been covered bya landslip‚
hasbeen regained by judiciously removing the soil piled over it;
and thus Caesar’s siege works have been revealed to view, almost
as if they had been preserved in a museum. lt must therefore be
obvious that in these cases a contribution of immense importance
has been made towards the understanding of these campaigns;
and our gratitude for this is proportionate to the difficulty which
existed before in making them out with any cleamess. The
admirable atlas which accompanies the work 'also contributes
largely to make the reading of Caesar delightful.

As to the point of Caesar's landing-place in Britain, Mr.
Lewin’s calculations have been followed in preference to those of
the author of Jules Cesar, which appear to rest in part upon a
mistranslation slight in itself, but important in its consequences.
The subject is still so far from being clear of difficulty, that
any judgment upon it must be considered in some degree
provisional.

The text given is mainly that of Kraner and Nipperdey;
exceptions are noticed in their place. The notes of the former of
these editore, as also those of Mr. Long, differ somewhat in plan
from those of this volume3 but valuable references have been
made in the course of it to both these editions. lt may perhaps
be allowable to suggest that a learner should always in using the
present work study the early books first, as the explanations of
both words and things which are referred to afterwards are
naturally given in full in these books
