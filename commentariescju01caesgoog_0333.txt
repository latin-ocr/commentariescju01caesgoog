proconsul of Spain at this time, and as such had an army oi six legions
under his control. But he preferred remaining at Rome as triumvir, and

About this time he was occupied in building his gigantic theatre at
Rome to please the populace.

end ol a. 4. The weakness ol this consederacy was manifestly the length
os the line on which it was spread. Assuming the hostility of the
Armoricans, the line extended from Brest to beyond Coblenz. It was just
the kind ol case in which, as Tacitus says, ‘singuli pugnant, universi

residence there A.D. 502.λ ,
