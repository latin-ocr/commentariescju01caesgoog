298 ueras. soon vr, cunr. 13, 14:

113. [3.] ad se traducerent; seca 28, note a.

l. ¹7· [4.] Divitiacum see 1. 19, note 4

l. ²3· [5.] reliquis rebus, ‘by all other means!

l. ²5· [6.] quos quod adaequare inmanissimum as it was
understood that they balanced (the Aedui) in influence with Caesar!
It is unusual (except in the perfect tense) to have this impersonal con-
struction with ‘intelligon’ Caesar apparently wishes to avoid the
sound of‘ qui' with ‘ii' following and referring to a different subject.
‘Adaequo' is used absolutely, as in Cic. Quint. a. 6, ‘equitum urna
adaequavit‚' ⁸ the votes of the knights were balanced!

132. [o.13.n.1.] aliquo numero,‘in anyconsideration.’ See5.5,note2.

l. 33. [a] plebes, ‘the (rural) population'

P. 120. l. 1. [3.] nullo oonsilio. This must apparently be dative
(like ‘ alterae' in 5. 27), as Caesar uses with ¹ adhibeo' only the regular
constructions. 1t should be remarked that ⁶ alterius‚' ‘nullius’ are the
older forms: and if Caesar wrote the above words he must have been
touched with the mania for making language uniform which made
Cato the censor use such words as ‘sacrem isti modi.⁸ and even
‘fitur, fiebanturl

l. 7. [4.] religionen, all omens and the like.

1.11. [5.] si caedes facta. The Druids in Cnesar's time had mani-
festly nothing to do with the political government of statem but it is
quite intelligible that they should retain this jurisdiction‚ based on
religious sanctiens only. The instance of Samuel is obvious.

1. ¹4· [6.] saofificlia interdicunt, this excommunicatiou Caesar
sometimes uses for his own purposes by getting a rebel banned
(6. 44)-

l. ar. [7.] aut el qui, διο.. ‘the most dignified of the rest, if any such
there be’

1. ²4· [8.] ln finibus carnutum, probably where the town of Dreux
now stands. So Anglesey was the Druid headquarters in Britain.

l. 29. [9.] diligentium see ι. 4ο, note 6.

P.121.1.5.[e.14.n.1.]0um utantur: see 5. 26, note a.

l. 7. [a] quod neque velint, quasi-oblique, ‘became it is supposed
that they do not wish!

l.11.[3.]animesab allis transire ad alios. One of the noblest
passages in Lucan (1. 450) is an expansion of this sentence. A fine
translation of it is quoted in Pict. Hist. of England. vol. 1, p. 61.

l. 13. [4.] multa . . disputant, 'they also theorise largely.’

l. 14. [5.] mundi ao terrarum, ‘of the universe and the globe' The
process by which ‘mundus’ came to have this meaning is curions.
Originally it siguified an order or outfit; thus ‘mundus muliebris’ stands
for a ledy's toilet requisites in the discussions on the Oppian law (Livy
34. 7), and ‘habere in inundo' means ‘to have in stock' in old writers.
