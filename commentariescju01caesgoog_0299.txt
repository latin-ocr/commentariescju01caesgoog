1.11.[6.] productis Romanorum copiis, ‘although the Romans
formed their line for battle,¹ concessive abl. absolute.

l. 13. [7.] opinione timeum see 3. 17, note 7. Here the meaning
is ‘from the idea which they had given our men of their cowardice.'
This, however, is an emendation for ‘atque opinione timidiores hostes'
which the MSS. read. If the old reading is retained, the meaning must
be ‘and from their having shown themselves more timid than their
re utation.'

h 16. [8.] omnibus cupientibus, ‘and finding them all ardent’ So
we have the dative ‘cupientibus signum dat,’ as he found them anxious
for battle he gave the signal. A similar ellipse of the ‘verbum sen-
tiendi' is found in the form ‘quum iam non possent,¹ ‘as they found
themselves now unable?

111. [ο. 25. n. 1.] opinionem pugnantium, ‘an impression as if
they were combatants! See 1. 14, note 4.

1.13.[1,] ex loco superiore missam causative. The participle
might be omitted without altering the sense. See 1. 33, note 3.

l. 15. [4.] ab decumana porta3 on 1111 side of the decuman gate.
So we have the phrases ‘a fronte‚' ‘ab oriente,' ‘lex facit a nobis,' ‘the
law is on our side: ‘ab hoste stare* ‘to side with the enemy! The
gate named is the one to the rear of the camp. On the derivation of
the term, see Dict. Antiq. marna, ξ 6, and Donaldson's Varronianus,

l. 3ο. [1.] intritae, a participle negatived, like ‘illaesus’

l. 33. [3.] prius quam videri posset. It is well to remark a frequent
dfflerence between the indicative and conjunctive with ‘antequam' or
‘priusquam' In 1· 53, Caesar says, ‘neque prius fugere destiterunt,

quam ad flumen Rhenum pervenerunt? Here the indicative throws a

narrative stress on ‘pervenerunt' making it mean ‘until they reached
the Rhine‚ as in fact they did reach it: But ‘priusquam videri posset'
means before they could see, without implying that they ever saw. So
Sall. Jug. 54 (fin.) ⁶ priusquam ex castris subveni1·etur‚iu proximos colles
