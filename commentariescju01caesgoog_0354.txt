NOTES. BOOK VII, CHAP. 22, 23. 315

l. 8. [a] paene ln eo ai retinuissent. their final triumph depended
mainly on the point of their retaining this city. Though most MSS.
read‘ penes eos,’ this correction seems almost necessary. The saving
of Avaricum was necessary to them rather negatively than positively;
to lose it was ruin, but to keep it was not victory.

l. 11. [o. 22. ιι. 1.] occurrebant, as in 7. 16, note 3.

1. 11. [a] ut est summae genus sollertiae; see 3. 8, note 4.

l. 13. [3.] laqueis falces avertebant. The ‘falces' seem to have
been a kind of battering ram with both a point and a hook. See Jules
Cesar (vol. a, p. 128, note). The nooses were employed, as in the great
siege of Plataea (Thuc. a. 76), first to break the blow byturning it in
an oblique direction, and then by drawing the sliding knot tight, to
drag the ram from its position by means (apparently) of windlasses.

l. 18. [4.] tumbam see 5. 40, note 1.

1. aa. [5.] commissis sumum turrium malis seems to mean ‘by
adding fresh lengths of scaffolding :’ for the verb implies' actual contact;
and therefore Kraner’s interpretation ‘by building together the scaffold·
ing poles,' seems hardly admissible.

l. 23. [6.] apertos cuniculos, ‘and when we opened mines, they

’ ’ countermined them from above: and from their own gallery sometimes

thrust sharpened stakes into the line of ours; sometimes poured boiling
pitch upon our working parties, sometimes even dropped into our
galleries pieces of rock large enough to close them up for the time·

l. 26. [o. 23. n. 1.] trabea directae, beams laid at right angles to
the trace of the wall.

1.26.[2.] perpetuae in longitudinem. and continued round the
whole enceinte.

l. ²9· [3.] vestiuntur. These timbers are framed together by ties,
filled in with earth, and riveted with blocks of stone occupying the
two-foot intervals between bean-head and bean-head.

l. 3²· [4.] neque inter ao contingant trabas, the second course
was entirely of stones: this was then continued by a third alternating
with the first in the position of its timber and stone That this is the
meaning is proved by a representation of such a wall on Trajan's
column.

2147. 1. a. [5.] oum . .. deforme ιιοιι est: the indicative is used
here, as it would have been if the phrase had been ‘est‚ cnm non
deforme, tum opportunum! So Cic. ad Fam. 3. 9, has ‘quum ipsam
cognitionem iuris augurii consequi cupio, tum tuis incredibiliter studiis
delector) Madwig, p. 313. The principle of the architecture is that of
the beautiful old houses in Shrewsbury‚ Chester, Rouen, Warwick, &c

l. 6. [6.] quac perpetuis trabibus, ‘for as its beams extend in·
wards without interruption for forty feet, andare also lirmly bolted
together, they canum be either brcached or drawo.'
