l. ²4· [4.] meruiese: ‘that they had served without ever suffering a
single defeat!

l. 26. [5.] laturos si reliquissent3 the actual words of the soldiers
(of which these are the oblique form) were ‘feremus si reliquerimus.¹

l. 28. [6.] quam non percuterent, understand ‘ut' So Cic. Tusc.
a. 22, ‘perpessus est omnia potius quam conscios . .. indicaret: For
the word see Ov. F asti, a. 546.

l. 33. [7.] propius Avaricum, on the eastern side.

1².144.1. 1. [o. 18.] inter equites: see note 1, on 7. 13, note 1.

l. 11. [c. 19. n. r.] non letior, &c., ‘although not more than fifty feet
wide.¹

l. ra. [a] generatim in civitatee, ‘state by state, according to
their extraction.¹

1. 13. [3.] vade eo saltus, ‘all the shallow points and all approaches
to the bog! By ‘saltus’ appear to be meant the descents of the hill

one who saw the uearness of their position thought that they were
ready for battle on almost even terms.’

l. 18. [6.] inani simulatione. This is rather hard on the Gauls,
as Caesar had used the same means of defence against the Belgian
confederacy (a. 8). We see a shade of vexation at the failure of his
welldevised ceap-demutat. It is curious to compare the expressions here
with those used in c. 5², in narrating the same event.

l. a 5. [7.] sua salute cariorem, ‘dearer than his own welfare?

P. 145. l. 5. [o. 20. n. r.] persuasum, &c., ‘as for his having

to him by the admirable character of the position!

l. 5. [a] se ipsum, ‘which defended itself by its own strength'
(compare 1. 38, ‘oppidum natura loci sic muniebatur,' ‘was so strong
by the very character of its site '). There was no need for altering
'ipsum' to ¹ ipse’ (as some editors do), as we have in Cic. (pro Corn. a),
¹ dicere de ips0,' and the reflexive may therefore be in the object.

l. 6. [3.] neque desiderari debuisse, &c., ‘on theone hand ought
not to have been wanted in so marshy a position, and on the other had
been useful where they went!

1.18.[4.]tpsts remittere, &c., ‘he offered to resign it at once to
them!

l. 25. [5.] si quid reperire possent, ‘to try if they could find any·
thing!

claslr of arms is in like manner mentioued as a mode of assent.
