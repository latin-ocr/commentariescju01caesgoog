Ιὲ therefore comes to mean the ordered universe, just as rtrum does in
reek.

1. 18. [a] ut ipsi iniurias inferrent, in apposition with ‘quod’

1. 21. [3.] ambactos, a Celtic word, srom ‘ambaig’ ‘to lead: or
‘drive around oue!

l. aa. [4.] hano unam matiam noverunt. ‘this is the one only
source of influence with which they are acquainted.'

1. 25. [o. 16. n. r.] pro victimis, ‘by way of victims! It will be
observed that no instamus oi this kind oi sacrifice are given either by
Caesar or any other author as occum'ng in connection with the battles
oi the peri0d; and considering how caretully Caesar notes such insti·
tutions as that os the ‘soldurii' (3. aa), it may appear that Thierry
(4. 1) is right in considering that these horrors were bygone in Caesar's
time. The Romans themselves. it will be remembered, buried two
Gauls alive in the forum during the second Punic war, in order to
avert an omen (Livy aa. 57), aud that not for the first time, as the
passage shows. So did the Persians while invading Greece (Herod.

l. 30. [a] simulacra habent: there is a curious vngueness about this
expression. It would seem to mean that the images were of a kind to
be kept among them, and not, as the general tone would imply‚ wicker
cages made sor the occasion, with some resemblance to the shape of a
man. So in the words ‘quibus succensis' there is additional obscurity
oi conception. The firing ot mere wickerwork would hardly produce a
sufficient flame: on the other hand, if the image was placed on a pile ot
wood, as M. Thierry supposes, wickerwork would nothe the most
natural material ior it. This looseness of expression throws a degree oi
suspicion, it' not on the existence of the custom¹‚ yet on the lact that it
was current in Caesar’s time.

sense which we get from this passage is that the Gauls worshipped

¹ Dr. Prichard quotes from St. Foix (Hist. Essays) the account oi a custorn
which may have some reference to these ancient sacrifices. ‘There are still
(1760) some towns in the kingdom,’ the writer says, ‘where the mayor and
sheriff cause to be put into a basket one or two dozen cats and burn them
in the bonfire of the eve of St. John? ln case of a sturm the inhabitants·
ot' a fishing village near Whitby are said to kill their cats. This seems the
most otlhand way possible ot giving lite for life. retaining in fact the idea of
these sacrifices, as the French custom did their form.
