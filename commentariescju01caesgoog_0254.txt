noras, Boou r, carr. 12. 215

l. 33. [a] Aedui Ambarri, that is, the Aedui round the Arar'or
Saone' as ‘ambh' is the Greek ἀμφί. The main body os the nation
were on the east, os the middle Loire. Their dominions contained
Bibracte (Autun), the great druidical capital, and Noviodunum iNevers),
one oi the great commercia] cities oi Gaul.

P. 7. l. 1. [3.] necessarii, ‘close connections,’ ἀναγκαῖοι. Hence
‘necessitudo’ ior ‘friendship' It was remarked at Rome, as a pecu·
liarity in Caesar's style, that he used the word ⁴ necessitas’ in the sense
oi ‘ necessitudo’ (Meyer. Orat. Rom. Fragm. p. 412).

1. a. [4] sese depopulatis agris, ue, ‘that their lands had been
ravaged, and that now they could hardly keep the enemy from their
walls!

l. 5. [5.] nihil esse reliqum a partitive genitive, like Livy 34. 49,
‘nec quidquam iis pensi est, quid saciant!

l. 9. [c. 12. n. 1.] flumen est Arar, δια, ‘the Saone is a river which
flows,’&c

l. ro. [a] incredibili lenitat013 as compared with the Rhone,
Adige, Po, or Tiber, the Saone would seem very slow in its course.
At the time when these events took place. Caesar knew no streams
‘waning their lazy lilies ;’ and his allowing the expression to stand alter
the time of his British expedition favours the view that he wrote each
book oi the Commentaries at the close oi the year in which its events
occurred, aud afterwards niade no change in it.

1. 15. [3.] de tertia vigilia, ‘in the course oi the third watch’ The
passage was at Villefranche, or thereabouts. See 16, note a.

'l. 27. [4.] eius soceri. L. Calp. Piso, father of that Calpurnia who
is familiar to us from Shakspeare. For the word ‘pagus' see 4. 1,
note 5, and ior ‘ eius,' a. 15, note 4 The Tigurini have become the
prominent subject; whence the determinative, and not the reiierrive is
used to refer to Caesar.

l. η. [5.] iniurias: Pliny, Suetonius, and later writers use this word
in the simple sense of ‘ damage· That Caesar here uses itin its proper
sense, of damage done contrary to law, will be evident irom a corn·
parison oi chap. 14. See the notes on that chapter. The assumption
here is that all offensive warsare against Romans is necessarily wrong;
combined with a second that it becomes aRoman family to maintain,
generation aster generation, the same attitude towards particular foreign

, nations. This would sometimes be kindly and protective (Dict. Antiq.

Art. uosrgmu ad lin), sometimes hostile, as in the case oi the Flaminini
towards reece.

¹ Dr, Prichard derives the name of Arar from the Celtic 'arav‚’ ‘ gentle'

. (Apulis), and that oi the Garonne irom ‘garw‚‘ ‘rough‚¹ ⁴ impetuous.' The

name ‘Saone' is, also, probably irum the Gallie ‘ soghan' (segnis).
