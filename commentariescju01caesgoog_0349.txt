straits (to know) how to reach his army? Cic. Rosc. Am. 34, uses a
similar ellipse, ‘cuius manu percussus sit, non laboro.'

l. 9. [3.] si legiones arcesseret, he had to collect them from
Treves, Langres Sens (6. 44).

l. 18. [4.] antevertendum existimavit, a slightly antiquated ex·
pression. So Plautus uses the deponent (Bacch. 3. 5. ι),

'rebus aliis antevortar Mnesilochum ut requiram!

1. 26. [o. 8. n. r.] mons Cevenna, froin ‘helym' a back (Zeuss).
Even in the summer the passage oslered sorne difficulty to an army, as
we see from the derour made by the Helvetii to avoid it in Book 1.c. ¹²3
and from the lact that the high road hom Lyons to Rochelle passed (be-
fore railways were made) by Autun, Nevers, and thence along the Loire.

l. 27. [a] durissimo tempore anni, ⁸ on account ol its being the
severest season os the year’ (the end os February). So as expressions
of time we have ‘adventu Caesaris in Galliam‚' 'occasu sotis: aud a lew
others in the simple ablative.

l. 29. [3.] viis patefactis, by Aps and S. Cirgues, on the direct way
to Gergovia (Clermont). He had started from Vienne.

l. ²9· [4.] summo militum sudore, these admirable soldiers were
worthy ol the genius of their chief. This whole operation deserves the
closest attention.

P. 139. l. 4. [5.] neu (neve), the sameas ¹ et ne,’ 4. 17, note.

l. 6. [6.] ad se bellum translatum, probably ‘that the whole war was
transferred to them: much as Corn. Nep. Hann. 12, has 'miserunt qui
a Prusia rege peterent ne inimicissimum suum (sc. Romanorum) apud se
haberet! In both cases the reflexive is referred to a subject unusually
distant.

l. 9. [o. 9. n. 1.] usu ventura, ‘would happen’ The order may be
varied. as Cic. de Or. 1. 40, ⁶ quid, quod usu memoria patrum venit!
‘Usu' is the dative here, like ‘equitatu' ⁶ cornu!

l. 10. [a] Brutum adulescentem. This was the Decimus Junius
Brutus well known to Shakespeare readers. He could he lest with
sasety. as he had a clear pass behind him, and Vercingetorix was sar
away to the north.

1. 14. [3.] suis inopinantibus, ‘without his own men having a notion
what he was doing! These admirable movements completely took
away the initiative lrom Vercingetorix.

l. 23· [4.] Gorgobina. The Boii had been placed (1. alil on the
extreme edge ol the Aeduan territory; aud. apparently in the lork of the
Loire and Allier‚ at or near S. Parize le Chatel. There are curicus
evidences that this spot was occupied by a tribe ol soreigners. See Jules
Cesar, 2, p. 248. As ‘ob' and ‘oban' mean in Celtic ‘a port' or a
reluge. we may suppose that the names ‘Gergovia' aud ‘Gorgobiua'
are compounds ol these words with ‘ guerg’ strong.
