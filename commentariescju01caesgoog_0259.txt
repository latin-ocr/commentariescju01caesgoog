chap. 4, note 3.

1. ²5· [4.] Divitia'voi fratris. Divitiacus. though a Druid of high
rank, was the most Romanized of all the Gauls. In no. 63 he had
gone to Rome to obtain help for his country against Ariovistus (6. ιι).
The Senate being occupied at the time with Catiline's conspiracy,
deferred their answer; and Divitiacus remained at Rome, frequenting
the best society, and enjoying the acquaintance of Cicero, who con·
sulted him, as a Druid, on the subject of his treatise de Divinatione
(de Div. 1. 41, and Thierry. book 5. chap. 3). The name is derived
from the Celtic ‘diu’ a god, whence ‘deadhach,‘ ‘religious’ (Gliick, p. 5).

l. 3ο. [5.] quotidianis interpretibus, &a¹ ‘dismissing the ordinary
interpreters'

P. 12 L 3. [6.] sine eius offensione enimi: see 3.18‚ note 4:

l. 16. [4.] futurum uti averterenture clrap. 10, note s.

l. 19. [5.] rogat finem orandi faciet. As in chap. 14, it is well to
remark the gracefnl way in which the historic presente at the end of this
, chapter relieve and lighten the strict oblique constructions at the begin»
ning; and how the short successive sentences bring the narrative to arr
agreeable close, with the air of a complete summary.

l. 21. [6.] eius voluntati condonendtc„ ‘thet in consideration of
his good-will he would not punish the wrong done to the republic or
his own personal annoyances'

l.28.[0.21.n.1.] hostes sub monte consedisse. After crossing
the Saone near Villefranche‚ the Helvetii had passed hy S. Vallier3 and
were now encamping at the foot of Mont Tauffrim near Issy l¹Eveque
' The road up to this point had been one on which no military manoeuvre
was possible.

l. 50. [a] qualis esset nature montis, &c., ‘he sent scouts to
ascertain the character of the hill, and the chance of ascending it on
its various sides! The Mont Tauffrin was apparently the first height
sufficiently parallel with the road to conceal a flank movement slightly
to the left of it, made for the purpose of heading the Helvetii and
barring the road in advanoe of them.

1. 32. [3.] de tertia viglllm the night-watches began at sunset and

military hours (Jules Cesar, vol. a. app. B).
