versus.¹

Ρ. 129. l. r. [a] ques ad Aduatucos adleoetz though Tongres was
iu this part of the Eburonian territory, it could not 'be considered
occupied by Q. Cicero, sor he had been ordered not to stir from his
camp lor aweek. Trebonius, by keeping his moveable column in
Cicero's neighbourhood, would strengthen caesare point d'oppm', and
keep the communicatiou with Rheims open. Labienus, meanwhile, was
to dn've the enemy up towards the isle os Bommel. Caesar, with the
three remaining legions, went towards Brussels and Antwerp.

l. 5. [5.] post diem septimum. ‘aster six days' See 4. 28, note r.

1. 8. [4.] reipublicae commodo; see 1. 50, note r.

l. 9. [5.] ud eum diem, like ‘ad horam,’ ‘ad tempus: aud the like:
briefly, that is, lor ⁸ to the place at a fired time.'

l. 12. [o. ³4. n. 1.] manus oerte nulls, ‘no regular and combined
torce' See 6. 31.

l.14.[2.]va11es, an ancient iorm for ‘vallis’ So there exist the
forms ‘aedis’ ‘ selis: ‘vulpis' as well as ‘aedes’ ‘seles’ ‘vulpes'

l. 16. [3.] vicinitatibus, ‘were known to the neighbourhood,' aud
therefore could be ascertaiued by enquiry.

L 18. [4.] ab perterritis, understand ‘illis ς’ they could do no harm
to the main body, broken aud daunted as they were.

clement in the safety of the whole army.

l. ar. [6.]si1vaeinosrtis itineribus. the woods with their baffling
and ill-marked tracts.

l. 23. [7.] stirpem sceleratorum. ‘the whole accursed brood.' By
‘scelus' is meant the breach ol a law owned even by bad men; an act
which all would simply detest; that lor instance ol au Ambiorix or a
Nana in breaking a capitulatim.

l. 29. [8.] utin eiusmodi difflorrltatibus, ‘considering that the

difficulties were os this kind?
l. 33. [9.] omnes ad sevocat, as isto amois-hunt. Merivale (vol. 1,

p. 496) characterises the act well and lorcibly. But to appreciate the
elements oi the questions, we should for a moment put our own use
os Sikhs and Goorkhas against Sepoys in the place oi that'made by
Caesar ol Nervians and Aduatuci.

Ρ. 130. l. 8. [c. 35. n. 1.] quantum fortuna possit, in ‘hoisting the
' engineer with his own petard.' This harping on ‘fortuna’ ever since
the British expedition betrays akind of wavering in Caesar's fatalist
views and trust in himself. He trusted his ‘felicitas’ in 1. 40, a. 28,
tries to persuade himself that it still exists (though appearances are
against it) in 4. 26, 5. 23, hali admits that it is against him in 6. 30, and
finally, in 6. 42, finds a balance in his favour.
