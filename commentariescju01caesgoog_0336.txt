l. ao. [5.] Chamaom ab Suebis prohiberi, caesar appears to be in
error about the position ol these tribes. As the Suevi (Chatti) are in
Hesse Kassel, and the Cherusci between the Weser and Elbe, they are
not, as he supposes, divided by the Thuringerwald. It is true, however,
that this range makes a great barrier between the uations north and
south os it. Its difficulties hindered the junction of the Bavarians with
the Hanoverians just before the battle ol Langensalza: see Hozier‚ The
Seven Weeks' War, vol, ii.

l. ²4· [o. 11, u. 1.] quoniam ad huno locum perventum θοις as the
military operations to be recouuted have no marked character.

l. 28. [a] pagis paruumque, ‘in all cautons and sections ol
cantons.’

1. ²9· [3] factiones sunt, so Tacitus says of Britain (Agriani,
'Olim regibus parebant, nunc per principes factionibus et studiis
trahuntur,' and he adds, ‘nec aliud pro nobis utilius’ Caesar manifestly
considers that this institution of patronage was older than the demo· ,
cratic constitutions in Gaul (1. 3, note 6). Exaotly in the same way
we find it existing under the oligarchic constitution at Athens: but the
στάσειε gained infinitely more power when democracies were established
(see Arnold‚ Thucyd. vol. 1. App. 1).

1. 31. [4.] quorum ad arbitrium summa aarum redeat. This
cannot mean that the chiefs os the sactions are the leaders most esteemed
by the goveruments ol the various states: ior we have seen in 1. a, note 1,
and 1. 17. note 1, that the greatest dangers to the established govern-
meuts arose from them. The sense must probably be that the chiess
are selected by the men ot' iuflueuce. those who can osny the rest oi the
party with them.

l. 3²· [5.] etus rai eausa, ‘because of the existence ol these
sactions.¹

l. 3²· [6.] antiquitus institutum. The unciaru institution of client·
ship would doubtless have been that os the Scottish olan or Irish sapt,
in which, as Spenser expresses it, the chiostain was ‘spent aud desended'
by his clansmeu, and also bound to avenge any iujury done to any ol
them (as, e g.‚ by challenging a neighbour sor wrouging his blaeksmith).
This has to be distinguished from two kinds of elieutship existing under
the republican govemments; first the voluntary gattering round a rich
man like Orgetorix, and secondly the voluntary combinations formed
iu the towns against the nobles who wished to reduce them to their old
dependence (Thierry, book 4, c. 1).

P. ue. l.8.[o.1a.n.1.] magnae eorum arant clientelae, ‘as
they had many states dependent on thena’ in the way iu which Aargau
and the Pays de Vaud were dependent on Berne till the French inter·
serenae in 1797.

l. 9. [a] magnis lecturis, ‘hy great sacrifices!
