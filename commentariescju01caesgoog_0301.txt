l. 6. [3.] premebantur3 as ¹ complures annos premor ' would mean
‘I have sor many years been pressed’ (praeteritum ad praesens, a past
time lasting till the present: see 3. 5, note 1); so iu this place ‘pre-
mebantur' means ‘they had been hard pressed’ ,

1. 7. [4.] Suebi, this appears srorn Mommsen, Hist. of Rome, to be
the correct orthography. The name seems etymologically connected
with ‘schweifen' and to mean ‘the rangers, nomads :’ not unnaturally,
considering their manner of lise, as stated in this chapter, and in
Tacitus (Germ. 38), who is followed by modern authors. Mommsen,
Hist. ol Rome, vol. 4. 1, p. ²3². states that it denotes a number ol
nations, and supposes the Chatti to be the one intended here.

l. 8. [5.] uentum pagos3 the proper meaning ol ‘pagus' in Italy
appears to have been ‘a military district round a sortified place!
In other countries it meant one of the larger subdivisions; as in the
country of the Helvetii. where there were four (1. ra). Military orders
were, therefore, addressed by the commander·in·chief to the various
‘pagi' (7. 64). But the civil divisions naturally followed the military
divisions: so the ‘princeps’ or Landamman (7. 23), elected by the
‘concilium’ or general assembly os the people (Tacit. Germ. υ),
administered justice for his own ‘pagus’

·l. 10. [6.] qul domi manserunt, ‘who have in each year remained
at home.' .

l. 13. [7.] privati agri nihil3 the only produce which they extrem
from the earth is corn (Tacit. Germ. 2⁶), and even of this they
usevery little.

l. 14. [8.] longius ann03 this prohibition probably had two objects;
first, that the ground might not get too exhausted to bear crops
with next to no culture: secoudly‚ that the people might contract
no ties with the soil. See Hor. Od. 3. 24, 13, sor a poetical view
of the arrangement, and infra ⁶. aa.

1. 15. [9.] maximam partem, acc. of reference. So Livy 5. 14,
‘omnes patricios, maximam partem honoratissimum quemque, creavere.¹

1. 17. [to] quae res: see 1. 4, note 1.

1, 17. [11.] oibt genere, ‘from the character ol their leod!

l. 18. nullo officio, the ablutive (Madw. ᾗ 267): literally ‘trained by
noduty.’

P. 66. 1. a. [ra] homines efficit, &car the word ‘homines’ is used
adjectively‚ ‘makes them meu of immense statura· See 1. a, note 6,
