l. 19. [e. 21. ιι. 1.] Cenimagni, in Bedford and Cambridge; (laesi,
ιιι Hertfordshire; Segontiaei, apparently near Silchester; Ancalites,
on the Themes, near Henley; Bibroci, uncertain.

l. ιι. [a] oppidum cassivellauni, thought, on slight evidence, ιο be
St. Alban's. As to Caesar’s explanation of ‘oppidum’ it may be re·
membered that in many provincial dialects the word ‘ town¹ even now
means simply an enclosure, farmyard. or the like. The conesponding
British word was probably ‘dun' (Prichard, Hist. os Manlrind, vol: 3,
p. 126), as in modern Welsh ‘dines’ means cithera casile or a city.
The Romans called it ‘d'unum'

l. 31. [3.] comprehensi atque interfanti, ‘overtaken and eut down!

1³. 94. 1. rs. [e. 22. ιι. ι.] atque id . . extrahi posse. ‘and that this
time might easily corne ιο an end: if further delay was made. Kraner
quotes B. Civ. 1. 52, ‘dicendi mora dies extrahentur) A special cause
of disturbanoe was now agitating Caesar. He had just heard of the
death of his daughter, Julia, the wife of his colleague Pompeius. Thus
almost the onlyfemaining bar against civil war was removed. See
Lucan 1. 115.

1.13. [a] vectigalis: no garrison was left behind, and therefore no
tribute ever paid. Cicero also expresses disappointment at the fact that
no gold was found in Britain, and only the rudest kind of slaves (ad.
Art. 4. 16). As to the desolation which Caesar left behind him in
Britain, we have an indirect evidence in Dion (41. 30), who represents
Caesar as saying, ‘Who would not grieve if he saw Italy laid as
thoroughly waste as Britain ι’ See 5. 48, note 4.

1. 19. [ο. 23. n.1.] duobus commeatibus, ‘by two relays :’ lit. ‘two
goings backwards and iorwerds.' From this original meaning sprang
also the two senses of ⁸ provision' and ⁴ furlough.'

l. ιι. [a] neque ulla desideraretur; an attempt to prove that the
‘pristina fortuna' which had been so rudely slraken was now returning.
See 4. 26, note 5.

l. 32. [ο. 24. ιι. n] Samarobrivae, ‘at Amicus: lit. ‘the Somme
Bridge.

Ρ. 95. 1. a. [a] legiones distribuere, yet not in the west of
France, the ‘loca maxime frumentaria’ of 1. ro, but evidently in the
parts where he expected a rebellion to arise.

l.4. [3.] Quinto Ciceroni; this officer had commanded a legion
through the second British campaign; Caesar having appointed him in
order ιο win his eminent brother to his cause; or, rather, as Mommsen
suggests, by way of gustantes that neither of the brothers should plot
a ainst him.

gl. 5. [4.] Esubios, in west Nonnandy, near Seez.
’ 1. 5. [5.] in Remis ς the principle of the arrangement os these troops
is easily discemible. Durocortum or Rheims was their central point.
