hand hindered the enemy from pushing vigorously any advantage which
they gained, and on the other made our men firmer lrom feeling

1. 23. [3.] summum iugum nacti, &c., ‘by gaining the crest os a
low hill on the right, they succeeded in outflanlring one ol the Gallie
divisione?

Vercingetorix' camp. ”

P. 170. l. 2. [c. 68. n. r.] Alesiam, the identity os this place with
Alise la Reine is proved with imperial decisiveness by the author of
Jules cesar. His researches have discovered the walls oi the town, the
Gallic camps, the lines ol' circumvallation, the positions of several of
Caesar’s redouth, the trace oi his ditches, the soil deposited by the
water drawn into them srom the rivers, and the trace ol the Roman
camps. Finally the places where, according to the narrative, most os
the enemy were slain have been detected hythe abundance os coins,
arrowheads, &c., found there, and a line ol barrows has been sound to
mark the resting·places ol those who sell on the retreat. See the fine
plan (Plate 25), or the sketch given in the text.

have been discovered, leading directly from the camp of Vercingetorix
to Alesia.

1. 8. [4.] altero die, on the next day but one. The succession oi
days is expressed by ‘proximu altero, terrio: &c., (Cic Phil. 1.13).
This does not however apply to the phrase ⁴ post diem quartum! See
4. 28, note 7. It is a pity that Caesar's notiori of symmetry makes him
abridge the narrative at this point. The loss and deleat ol Vercinge-
torix, as related, are hardly enough to account lor his retreat within the
walls oi Alesia.
