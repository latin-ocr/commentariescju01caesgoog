¹ P. 188. l. 4. [4.] superiore bollo, the Allobroges had been fearfully

foppressed by Fonteius, whom Cicero so strangely and inconsistently

defended. They had earned the gratitude of the senate by revealing
the Catiline conspiracy; but not satisfied with its results, they rose and
were crushed in B.C. 63. (See Thierry, lib. 5, c. a, fin.) Since then,
they had been embodied in the Roman province.

l. 5. [5.] totius provinciae, ‘ os the whole Roman province!

l. 8. [c. 65. n. 1.] 1.. caenare, it is impossible to say what relation
L. Caesar was to Julius Caesar, as it is unknown who was the great
grandfather of the latter. He was an older member of the same
family, one of the judges of C. Rabirius, and proscribed by his nephcw
M. Antonius in ΒΩ. 43.

l. 15. [a] interclusis itineribus, ‘if the roads were occupied.¹

l. ao. [3.] minus idoneis equis, as in 4. a, the German horses are
said to be mere hardy ponies.

l. 21. [4.] sed et equitibus, all early editions read thus. If right,

¹ the meaning is, ‘and also from the Roman knights! Compare ‘ex

testamento Tiberii-sed et Liviae Augustae! (Suet. Cal. 16.)

’ l. 21. [5.] evocatis, men of the staff-corps, (Class. Dict. p. 508.)

l. 25. [c. 66. n. 1.] in sequanos. Caesar probably wished to malsc
Besancon his headquarters. To get there from Gergovia he would ford

· the Loire at Bourbon Lancey, turn north so as to avoid the now hostile
meduan country .(and= at the same time to effect his junction with

Labienus) as far as Joigny or thereabouts ; then strike across by way of
Langres, cross the Saone at Gray or Pontaillier, and so anive at
Besanpon. The battle now to be described was on the river Vingeanne,
just east of Dijon. See Jules Cesar (plate 24l. .

1. 28. [a] trinis castris. Vercingetorix advanced from Bibracte by
way of Thil Chatel and formed three camps on eminences, south of the
Roman position, so as to command the three possible ways to Besancon,

‘that by Gray, that by Pontaillier, and that by Chalons sur Saone. He

hoped in this way to be ableto attack Caesar's army while still in
column, as it neared the heights of Sacquenay on whichhe was posted.

P. 169. 1. a. [3.] suia auxilium ferant, &c.‚ ⁸ if the infantry defended,
their baggage train and camp followers, this must necessarily check
their retreat!

l. 6. [4.] quin ‘nemo andent3 see 1. 4, note 8.

1. 6. [5.] progredi modo, ‘even to advance the least! See 6: 8,
note 3. 1

1.7.[6.] et ipsos'quidem non debere, unusually, for ‘ne ipsos
quidem debere.¹ Kraner quotes 5. 52, ‘neque etiam parvulo detrimento
locum relinqui videbat!

l. 8. [7.] id quo faciant, that his cavalry might attackthe enemy.
The reference is to ‘impeditos adorirentur!
