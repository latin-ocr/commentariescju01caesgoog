INTRODUCTION.

Caussa's Commentaries have been universally aclrnowledged
to be the best of manuals both of Latin style and of the mili-
tary art. As to the former point, they have all the consummate
clearness which belongs to genius thoroughly informed as to the
facts which it is relating. Compare with them Sallust's account
of the Jugurthiue war, and one becomes instantly aware of the
differ-enee between a fancy account ofa campaign, such asa
rhetorician can work out hom secondhand information, and one
which never, even in its most rhetorical passages, falls to maintain

· the tone of real, unmistaheable fact. The mode of narration in

the Commentaries is so eamest, serious, and straightforward,
the logie of events is so closely imit, the words have so strong
an appearance of being selected with a view to expressing the
simplest truths in the simplest way, that it is only by an effort
that we can bring ourselves to criticise the statements which
they contain, and examine how far they represent reality. We are
never put on our guard, as we often are in reading Livy, Cicero,
or Tacitus, by passages whose very eloquence makes us at once
suspect concealment of fact. Nothing seems introduced for the
sake of antithesis3 no colouring, or hardly any, is ever added
for the purpose of giving an adventitious interest to the scene3
yet a natural euphony and grace pervades the whole. The style
easily and naturally sympathises with the most various circum·
stances of the history; it is forcibly rhetorical in Book I, where
the right of the Roman people as against the Helvetii or Ariovistus,
as viewed by Caesar, has to be put in the strongest light possible3
indeed, in a light stronger than the truth allows. lt can collect
itself into long and involved periods‚ where an accumulation ol
danger and difficulty bas to be described, as in the Nervian battle
in Book ΙΙ. lt can summarise rapid events with singular force
