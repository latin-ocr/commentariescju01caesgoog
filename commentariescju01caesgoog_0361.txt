show of organized resistanee. lt seems more probable that the recall
sounded by Caesar was intended to make the advanced legions fall back
upon himself; that the words ‘consecutus id quod animo proposuerat ’,
mean ‘finding himself in possession of the opportunity he desired;’ that
is, that he had been tlrusfor successful, and that if the other legions had⁴
- heeded his recall¹ he would have reformed his troops and led them on
to a regular assault. As it was, the remaining legions, by their reckless
onset, entirely broke up his formation, and must themselves have left
behind the ladders, &e with which, as an assault was intended, they
must of course have been provided.

¹ ‘Receptui canere’ means to sound not a retreat but a recall. It is
often distinguished from a retreat, as by the author of the Bell. Alex. (47),
‘Vatinius receptui cecinit, suisque omnibus incolumibus in portum se vietor
recepit.¹ So we have in Caesar the phrases ‘receptui suorum tiurens,'
‘facilis receptus ad nos,’ and others, all pointing to the same idea.
